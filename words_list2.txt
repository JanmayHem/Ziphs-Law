all
his
life
rikard
had
defied
the
warlords
of
coper
city
but
even
the
stoutest
outlaw
could
be
outnumbered

rayth
offered
him
freedom
for
the
death
of
the

it
seemed

enough--until

"here
they
come!"
leda
voice
vibrated
in
the
ears
of
the
four
men
with
her
they
stood
with
their
helmets
touching
so
they
could
talk
eyes
looking
down
the
rugged
sweep
of
copernicus
to
the
force
which
came
running
upward
against
them
at
their
backs
the
brutal
heights
of
rock
climbed
for
the
stars
but
they
stood
in
a
recess
between
looming
crags
as
good
a
defensive
position
as
they
could
hope
for
"eight
nine--"
rikard
strained
his
eyes
through
the
queer
tricky
light
and
shadow--the
brilliant
rushing
blue
of
earth
nearly
in
full
phase
the
utter
dark
of
knife-edged
umbras
a
sprawling
savage
confusion
of
spires
and
cliffs
tumbling
down
toward
the
far
ghostly
shimmer
of
the
plain
"ten
at
least
i
make
it
probably
more
it'll
be
a
rough
fight."
the
tiny
metal-glinting
specks
bounded
closer
twenty-foot
leaps
from
height
to
height
and
now
they
could
see
the
sheen
of
earthglow
on
spears
and
axes
rikard
said
slowly:
"it
will
most
likely
be
death
if
we
make
a
stand
let
anyone
who
wishes
go
down
to
them
now
and
i
will
not
think
the
less
of
him."
"down
to
execution
or
enslavement?
you
should
know
us
better
than
that,"
said
huw
he
hefted
his
own
ax
and
shadows
crept
over
the
folds
of
his
flexicord
suit
"heh
they'll
have
to
come
at
us
only
a
few
at
a
time
we'll
mince
'em
as
they
do."
a
mutter
of
assent
rumbled
from
jonak
and
chungti
leda
remained
silent
but
one
gauntletted
hand
closed
on
rikard
arm
the
outlaw
chief
gaunt
dark
face
flashed
in
a
brief
grin
"thank
you,"
he
said
"we'll
at
least
show
the
damned
copers
that
nyrac
can
still
fight."
he
moved
away
from
the
group
and
strung
his
bow
it
was
a
big
one
suitable
for
the
giant
who
wielded
it
and
had
been
in
his
family
for
a
long
time
plastic
bow
wire
string
steel
arrows
that
leaped
out
with
a
hundred
pounds
of
force
behind
them--such
a
weapon
could
pierce
a
spacesuit
and
come
out
the
other
side
in
a
rush
of
air
wood
and
cord
were
of
little
use
on
the
surface
they
dried
and
cracked
in
the
sucking
vacuum
sizzled
by
day
and
froze
by
night
but
with
this
weapon
he
had
sent
more
men
than
he
remembered
to
earth
standing
in
the
abysmal
shadow
of
a
crag
he
nocked
an
arrow
and
took
aim
the
bow
thrummed
in
his
hand
and
a
bright
shaft
sprang
forth
one
of
the
attacking
band
suddenly
leaped
up
fell
and
rolled
down
the
long
slope
with
the
moisture-laden
air
gushing
out
like
his
fleeing
soul
"there
one
less!"
cried
leda
savagely
and
raised
her
pike
none
heard
her
speak
in
the
looming
silence
but
they
saw
her
lips
laughing
behind
the
plastic
helmet
rikard
turned
for
a
glimpse
of
her
the
strong
fair
face
the
heavy
yellow
hair--turned
blue
and
green
now
by
the
pouring
earthlight
but
not
the
less
good
to
look
on
he
had
stolen
her
three
years
before
in
a
raid
on
moonburg
and
she
had
fought
him
bitterly
for
awhile
but
later
there
had
been
understanding
between
them
and
when
the
copers
overran
nyrac
and
he
and
a
few
men
fled
into
rebellious
exile
she
was
the
only
one
of
his
wives
who
had
come
with
him
they
smiled
briefly
at
each
other
and
then
he
faced
back
toward
the
enemy
his
bow
throbbed
again
and
he
cursed
as
the
shaft
whipped
past
a
nearing
figure
the
man
hurled
a
spear
it
bounced
off
the
crag
and
huw
stepped
forth
to
seize
and
throw
it
back
rikard
fired
once
more
and
another
warrior
tumbled
to
the
stony
ground
to
freeze
in
death
now
they
were
close
terribly
close
a
good
dozen
of
them
rushing
in
on
him
he
sent
a
final
snapped
shot
against
them
dropped
the
bow
and
grabbed
up
his
ax
swiftly
the
outlaws
fell
into
a
defending
line:
rikard
huw
and
jonak
the
heaviest
standing
shoulder
to
shoulder
between
the
two
great
pillars
leda
and
chungti
just
behind
them
with
pikes
at
the
ready
the
first
of
the
copers
hit
rikard
with
the
furious
velocity
of
a
broad
jump
ax
swinging
down
against
the
chief
helmet
rikard
caught
the
blow
on
his
own
weapon
handle
twisted
it
down
and
kicked
the
attacker
in
the
belly
he
bounced
away
wide
open
for
assault
but
it
wouldn't
do
to
leave
the
line
the
next
was
almost
instantly
on
the
outlaw
blade
cleaving
vacuum
rikard
ax
blurred
down
and
crashed
into
the
space
helmet
the
shock
of
the
blow
rammed
home
in
his
own
muscles
but
it
had
burst
open
the
tough
plastic
air
whirled
out
white
with
frost
red
with
the
blood
that
suddenly
foamed
from
mouth
and
nose
the
enemy
own
ax
had
dropped
from
his
fingers
as
rikard
blade
smashed
home
and
clanged
off
the
chief
helmet
rikard
smote
at
the
warrior
beyond
hit
a
metal
shoulder
plate
and
dodged
a
counterblow
leda
thrust
between
him
and
jonak
driving
the
pike
home
with
a
terrible
force
that
split
the
coper
suit
at
the
belly
he
lurched
back
clutching
futile
hands
against
the
streaming
air
his
face
distorted
with
unheard
screams
two
of
them
were
on
rikard
now
ax
and
spear
blows
clattering
off
his
helmet
and
shoulder
plates
as
he
dodged
and
parried
and
hewed
he
whirled
his
weapon
over
his
head
brought
it
crashing
down
to
break
another
helmet
and
the
skull
beneath
and
his
own
yelling
rang
in
his
ears
from
the
corner
of
one
eye
he
saw
jonak
fall
snarling
he
swung
on
the
killer
his
blow
parried
by
the
other
axhead
"go
to
mars
you
bastard!"
he
growled
and
hailed
blow
after
blow
against
the
enemy
guard
a
leaping
dancing
fury
of
steel
that
drove
the
fellow
back
until
he
was
against
a
cliff
rikard
sprang
in
and
slew
him
panting
he
whirled
around
to
see
that
the
copers
had
broken
his
line
that
they
raged
three
or
four
about
each
of
the
survivors
thrusting
and
smiting
a
flicker
of
light
and
hard
metal
against
the
monstrous
blacknesses
of
shadow
even
as
he
watched
chungti
went
down
with
a
spear
in
him
huw
and
leda
stood
back
to
back
beating
off
the
pack
that
snarled
around
them
and
rikard
launched
himself
across
the
space
between
to
fall
on
the
copers
he
clove
one
helmet
from
behind
pitched
another
man
aside
parried
a
thrust
and
kicked
the
thruster
back
and
joined
his
comrades
a
cloudiness
of
freezing
moisture
fogged
his
helmet
and
huw
toppled
against
him
he
stood
over
the
body
and
struck
home
leda
swept
her
pike
in
a
wide
arc
got
it
between
a
man
legs
and
tripped
him
and
stabbed
him
before
he
could
rise
then
a
coper
got
between
her
and
rikard
threw
his
arms
around
her
from
behind
and
dragged
her
to
the
ground
they
closed
in
on
rikard
hemming
him
in
a
solid
wall
of
armored
bodies
bearing
him
down
and
holding
him
fast
with
four
men
on
each
arm
when
they
brought
forth
wire
and
began
lashing
his
hands
together
he
kicked
out
rose
to
his
feet
and
knocked
them
away
as
they
came
on
him
until
someone
else
tackled
him
and
he
went
down
once
more
captured
by
the
living
earth
no
clean
death
in
battle
but
captured
he
lay
gasping
the
hot
foul
air
of
his
suit
looking
up
to
the
crystal
dark
of
heaven
a
million
needle-sharp
stars
and
the
ghostly
glory
of
the
milky
way
up
to
earth
huge
blue
disc
and
the
world
the
moon-world
of
witchlight
and
shadow
and
cruel
fanged
stone
reeled
about
him
with
his
dismay
captured
a
tall
man
apparently
the
chief
of
the
band
counted
the
survivors
and
then
put
his
helmet
against
rikard
his
face
was
sharply
carved
dark-eyed
with
the
pointed
beard
of
a
coper
noble
and
the
hollow
cheeks
corpse-blue
in
the
light
he
said
slowly:
"yes
you
are
the
rebel
leader
i'm
glad
we
took
you
alive."
rikard
looked
sullenly
back
at
him
"behave
yourself,"
advised
the
other
"remember
we
hold
the
woman
too."





they
scaled
the
heights
of
copernicus
and
descended
to
the
plain
which
the
crater
ringed
in
not
far
off
was
an
armored
dome
with
sentries
before
it
one
of
the
airlocks
leading
to
a
tunnel
they
entered
this
and
came
to
the
long
tube-lit
bareness
underground
a
few
coper
soldiers
were
posted
here
taking
turns
at
guard
duty
on
the
outside
like
all
their
city
freemen
they
wore
more
clothes
than
the
outlying
barbarians
who
rarely
donned
more
than
a
pocketed
kilt
if
that
much--these
had
tunics
as
well
and
flat
steel
helmets
and
carried
the
swords
that
were
useful
underground
though
ineffective
against
a
spacesuit
nor
did
they
have
the
war-paint
of
barbarian
fighters
they
did
not
mock
the
prisoners--the
name
of
rikard
of
nyrac
had
been
too
frightening
for
the
past
year--but
they
leered
at
leda
even
the
outlaws
were
glad
to
shed
their
spacesuits
sweat
and
the
needs
of
nature
made
it
uncomfortable
to
be
outside
more
than
a
few
hours
at
a
time
they
were
stripped
their
hands
bound
behind
them
and
marched
between
an
alert
guard
down
the
tunnel
toward
coper
city
it
went
rapidly
the
long
bounding
pace
of
men
in
home
territory
who
had
no
ambush
to
fear
rikard
mind
whirled
over
the
catastrophes
of
the
past
hours
he
and
his
men--some
fifty
in
all--had
been
living
mostly
on
the
outside
since
the
fall
of
nyrac
a
year
ago
they
had
had
seal-tents
which
they
moved
from
place
to
place
and
had
descended
into
the
tunnels
and
cities
often
through
old
unguarded
airlocks
to
raid
for
food
water
air
and
the
killing
of
coper
men
while
they
fought
they
had
been
a
symbol
of
resistance
to
the
free
people
within
and
beyond
the
expanding
coper
empire
they
had
checked
its
advance
a
little
they
had
been
a
rallying
force
and
many
young
men
had
come
to
join
them
there
had
been
hope
then--rikard
and
his
four
companions
returned
from
a
scouting
trip
to
find
their
camp
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
they
had
fought
clear
had
been
pursued
and
finally
this
squad
had
hunted
them
down
and
captured
the
two
rebel
leaders--and
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
that
was
the
end--the
end
of
the
fight
the
end
of
hope
the
end
most
likely
of
life
his
bitter
dark
eyes
turned
on
the
leader
of
the
squad
that

had
donned
a
tunic
of
brilliant
colors
the
dress
of
a
mighty
noble
and
the
sword
at
his
waist
was
jeweled
"who
are
you?"
he
asked
coldly
the
lean
face
smiled
"i
am
rayth
prince
of
coper
city,"
he
answered
"it
was--fortunate
for
both
of
us--that
i
should
have
happened
to
lead
the
group
that
found
you
others
would
have
had
you
killed
out
of
hand
but
i
can
find
better
uses
for
you."
he
nodded
at
leda
"yes
indeed."
her
head
lifted
haughtily
shining
raw
gold
of
hair
spilling
over
broad
shoulders
to
her
supple
waist
rikard
snarled
and
wrenched
at
his
bonds
they
dug
harshly
into
his
wrists
and
a
guard
pricked
him
with
a
spear
rayth
held
rikard
bow
between
his
hands
"this
is
an
unusually
fine
weapon,"
he
said
"i
hadn't
thought
the
barbarians
had
anything
so
good
you
may
get
it
back
but
you'll
have
to
earn
it."





the
tunnel
opened
into
a
great
cavern
a
reaching
vastness
whose
farther
walls
could
not
be
seen
it
was
farmland
peasants
going
between
the
long
rows
of
tanks
and
tending
a
riotous
greenery
of
food
plants
an
occasional
hard-faced
overseer
pausing
in
his
rounds
to
salute
the
prince

went
by
a
stockyard
cattle
pigs
sheep
and
poultry
in
their
pens
slaves
cleaning
and
feeding
not
far
off
was
a
slaughterhouse
and
rayth
aristocratic
nose
crinkled
a
winding
ramp
led
up
through
other
levels
they
passed
the
drab
huddled
compartments
of
the
lower
classes
gray-clad
peasants
crowded
with
their
families
into
doorless
rooms
above
that
was
a
factory
level
where
acolyte
engineers
labored
over
weapons
and
tools
over
ore-smelting
and
refining
and
other
workmen
turned
out
clothes
and
cord
and
the
remaining
necessities
of
life
the
party
stopped
here
to
deliver
the
battle-torn
spacesuits
for
repair
flexicord
would
be
mended
plastic
melted
together
again
nobody
cared
about
the
stripped
bodies
withering
on
the
outside
rikard
could
not
forbear
to
ask:
"where
is
your
air
factory?"
"that
is
farther
up
in
the
temple
and
in
direct
charge
of
the
chief
engineer,"
said
rayth
politely
"it
is
after
all
among
the
most
vital
jobs."
he
raised
his
eyebrows
"you
didn't
have
an
air
plant
at
nyrac
did
you?"
"no
we
bought
or
took
it
from
elsewhere
as
needed."
"ah
i
thought
so
most
of
the
barbarians
do
now
rikard
you
are
a
man
of
intelligence
and
i
ask
you
to
think
a
bit
we
must
have
extra
air
to
replace
that
which
is
lost
one
way
or
another
but
it
takes
skill
and
some
equipment
to
get
it
from
the
minerals
in
which
it
is
locked
rather
than
war
on
us
one
of
the
few
places
where
they
can
produce
it
would
it
not
have
been
wiser
to
accept
us
in
friendship
and
receive
from
us
a
steady
and
dependable
supply?"
"we
were
freemen
now
we
are
slaves
and
must
grovel
to
your
overlords
and
give
them
all
we
make
in
exchange
for
a
miserly
ration
that
is
reason
enough
to
fight
you."
"i
don't
think,"
said
rayth
sardonically
"that
your
own
slaves
notice
any
change."
rikard
clamped
his
lips
tight
above
the
factory
level
was
a
park
it
was
known
that
the
life
of
the
air
and
hence
of
man
depended
on
green
plants
so
even
the
smallest
village
had
its
farms
and
even
the
outlaws'
crowded
seal-tents
had
contained
some
pots
of
vegetation
but
rikard
and
leda
had
never
seen
anything
like
this
riot
of
blooms
and
rearing
trees
had
never
felt
grass
soft
and
cool
beneath
their
bare
feet
and
the
girl
drew
a
gasp
of
wonder
and
buried
her
face
in
a
huge
sweet
cluster
of
roses
rayth
drew
his
sword
and
cut
the
flowers
and
handed
them
to
her
with
a
bow
"no
fairer
than
you,"
he
smiled
she
cursed
and
threw
them
at
his
feet
there
were
folk
of
noble
class
around
warriors
administrators
ranking
engineers
and
their
children
and
colorfully
gowned
women
they
gathered
about
laughing
shouting
cheering
and
rayth
nodded
affably
but
led
the
way
onward
above
the
park
were
the
levels
of
the
spacious
upper-class
apartments
where
others
of
gentle
birth
went
about
in
litters
and
slaves
scurried
humbly
on
their
errands
rikard
noticed
the
guardsmen
standing
rigidly
here
and
there
and
decided
that
the
power
of
the
overlords
was
not
so
secure
as
it
might
look
on
and
on
until
at
last
they
stood
before
a
high
wall
ornamented
with
murals
of
ancient
triumphs
and
festivals
four
sentries
stood
in
front
of
the
door
bringing
their
spears
to
rigid
salute
as
rayth
approached
a
footman
opened
the
door
and
they
were
ushered
into
the
prince
home
it
was
richly
furnished
with
hangings
and
vases
and
furniture
of
priceless
ancient
work--older
than
the
fall
it
must
be--as
well
as
the
clumsier
recent
articles
of
carved
wood
and
hammered
metal
rayth
led
the
way
to
a
spacious
chamber
whose
outer
window
looked
on
the
sky
automatically
rikard
stepped
over
there
to
make
a
survey
this
place
must
be
high
in
the
dome
which
rose
over
the
city
underground
levels
he
could
look
down
the
great
sweep
of
metal
and
concrete
to
the
rugged
plain
beneath
and
out
toward
the
sharply
curving
horizon
and
the
mighty
ringwall
which
shouldered
above
it
the
stars
thronged
and
blazed
in
a
cold
glory
of
sky
"unbind
them,"
said
rayth
rikard
stretched
mightily
rubbing
cramped
arms
leda
stepped
over
beside
him
and
her
hand
stole
into
his
the
guards
marched
out
except
for
two
who
stood
alertly
against
the
wall
"and
now
what?"
asked
the
barbarian
"why
i
suppose
you
will
want
to
clean
yourselves
there
is
a
bathroom
over
that
way
afterward
we
will
eat
and
then
we
can
talk."





there
were
garments
for
the
prisoners
of
a
soft
colorfulness
such
as
they
had
not
known
since
the
last
time
nyrac
captured
a
trading
caravan
in
the
tunnels
and
there
was
a
feast
of
skillfully
prepared
meat
and
bread
fresh
fruit
wine
and
delicacies
for
which
they
had
no
name
they
sat
around
the
table
and
gorged
rayth
exerted
himself
to
be
pleasant
he
brought
in
slave
girls
to
dance
and
play
he
kept
the
wine
glasses
full
and
the
words
that
flowed
from
his
smiling
lips
had
nothing
to
do
with
immediate
reality
despite
himself
rikard
had
to
listen
with
interest
and
reply
where
he
could
and
leda
sat
enchanted
the
prince
got
onto
ancient
history
which
seemed
to
be
a
pet
subject
of
his
he
discoursed
of
a
thousand
years
of
war
politics
conquest
and
liberation
dynasties
and
gods
and
people
and
after
the
vague
heroic
songs
of
the
barbarians
it
was
a
new
experience
to
listen
to
his
crisp
cynical
prose
they
could
still
read
and
write
in
coper
city
though
only
a
few
nobles
besides
the
engineers
took
the
trouble
to
learn
and
so
they
remembered
with
precision
"but
the
fall?"
whispered
leda
"what
was
that?"
"the
fall
from
earth?"
rayth
smiled
and
arched
his
brows
"well
my
fair
one
suppose
you
tell
me
what
you
think."
"why--i
never
thought
much
about
it,"
she
said
her
broad
clear
forehead
wrinkling
above
the
steady
blue
eyes
"they
say
that
man
came
from
earth
originally
and
sinned
and
was
condemned
to
dwell
in
the
world
here
until
the
sin
is
redeemed
the
souls
of
the
dead
return
to
earth--"
"or
to
mars
if
they
are
criminals
or
copers,"
grunted
rikard
leda
threw
him
a
little
frown
and
spread
her
hands
helplessly
"that
is
all
i
know."
"hm--well
it
the
general
story
our
engineers
tell
it
to
our
own
commons
since
it
helps
keep
them
in
check
but
what
would
you
say
if
i
told
you
earth
is
another
world
like
our
own?"
"it
couldn't
be,"
said
leda
"the
story
is
that
on
earth
you
can
walk
on
the
outside
without
a
spacesuit
and
there
is
green
everywhere
and
great
pools
of
water
and
everyone
has
enough
to
eat."
"oh
yes
beyond
doubt
earth
is
not
quite
the
same
as
luna
after
all
man
and
his
animals
are
so
ill
suited
to
life
here
that
i
think
it
only
reasonable
to
suppose
they
came
from
earth--not
in
any
mystic
fall
but
by
ordinary
physical
means."
"they
jumped?"
asked
rikard
scornfully
"no
they--well--i'll
come
to
that
later
they
had
ways
such
few
books
as
have
survived
tell
something
about
what
happened
men
came
here
from
earth
to
look
for
minerals
which
they
needed
cities
were
built
here
and
there
over
the
face
of
luna
and
tunnels
cut
to
connect
them
and
to
get
at
the
ores
they
were
wise
those
ancients
they
built
not
only
the
things
we
now
have
and
use
in
a
blind
fashion
by
rote
without
much
understanding--smelters
sun-power
accumulators
spacesuits
and
all
the
rest--but
they
had
other
things
as
well
weapons
more
deadly
than
bow
or
ax
machines
which
carried
them
over
the
surface
and
hauled
their
loads
and
did
the
work
we
must
do
by
hand--but
those
things
have
long
worn
out
or
been
destroyed
and
their
remnants
have
been
wrecked
for
the
metal
in
them
we
have
a
few
relics
in
our
temple
here
that
is
all."
rayth
eyes
gleamed
briefly
he
went
on
in
a
moment
"the
sin
and
the
fall
were
something
different
from
what
the
engineers
have
said
in
their
sermons
i
don't
know
exactly
what
happened
except
that
even
those
wise
ancients
were
not
united
they
were
divided
into--cities
i
suppose--and
the
separate
colonies
here
were
owned
by
these
various
cities
a
war
broke
out
not
a
war
as
we
know
war
but
something
with
doom
in
it
all
the
power
of
the
machines
turned
loose
to
blast
and
burn
it
must
have
destroyed
civilization
on
earth
at
least
there
have
been
no
visitors
from
there
in
a
thousand
years
or
more
here
on
luna
the
colonies
also
fought
but
in
a
more
limited
way
since
they
had
not
the
greatest
engines
of
destruction
but
it
was
enough
to
wipe
out
many
cities--you
must
have
seen
some
of
the
ruins--and
to
destroy
most
of
the
equipment
such
wise
men
as
survived
had
not
the
tools
to
work
with
to
rebuild
all
they
must
have
and
the
turbulent
new
generations
paid
little
heed
to
teachings
which
had
no
relation
to
their
own
experience
the
remaining
machines
wore
out
the
wise
men
died
the
cities
fought
with
swords
and
spears
for
the
necessities
of
life
and
finally
the
long
night
of
ignorance
fell
on
us
and
that
is
the
true
story
of
the
fall."
"how
do
you
know?"
challenged
rikard
"oh
i
have
read
the
remaining
old
books
and
fragments
of
books
and
used
my
own
head
to
piece
together
what
little
was
known
coper
city
has
kept
more
knowledge
than
the
others
anyway
those
went
back
to
naked
barbarism
retaining
barely
enough
tradition
to
survive
but
we
living
in
what
had
been
the
most
important
of
the
old
colonies
kept
somewhat
more
than
that
there
have
always
been
a
few
in
coper
city
who
knew
the
truth
though
they
lacked
means
to
do
anything
about
it."
rikard
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
surveyed
the
prince
with
arrogant
eyes
"all
right,"
he
said
"i'll
accept
it
what
the
difference
anyway?
what
do
you
have
us
here
for
and
why
are
you
telling
us
this?"
"oh--i
wanted
you
to
realize
that
our
frank
goal
of
conquering
the
world
is
not
the
unmitigated
evil
you
insist
it
will
bring
knowledge
to
the
barbarians
give
them
back
their
heritage
and
end
their
stupid
squabbling
in
a
unity
of
all
mankind."
"at
the
price
of
making
them
slaves
and
paupers!"
"well
i
didn't
say
we
were
doing
this
for
our
health,"
said
rayth
mildly
"the
outlier
raids
have
been
more
than
a
little
costly
and
annoying
to
us
and
of
course
we
can
always
use
more
workers
however
please
don't
tell
me
you
are
some
kind
of
martyr
whose
heart
bleeds
only
for
your
poor
oppressed
people
you
are
angry
because
your
wealth
and
power
were
stripped
from
you
if
you
could
get
those
back
threefold--"





his
keen
features
jutted
over
the
table
as
he
leaned
forward
"we
will
impose
the
social
pattern
of
coper
city
everywhere
yes
because
it
is
our
own
but
we'll
have
to
take
the
most
able
and
trustworthy
barbarians
into
our
own
noble
ranks
as
full
citizens
how
would
you
like
to
trade
the
circumscribed
darkness
of
nyrac
for
a
dwelling
like
this
a
score
of
slaves
a
personal
guard
a
city
for
your
private
estate?
how
would
you
like
a
hand
in
shaping
the
future?"
"hm."
rikard
scowled
and
ran
a
hand
through
his
stiff
black
hair
"you
won't
give
me
that
for
nothing."
"no
no
but
you'll
need
a
strong
patron
my
friend
everyone
else
will
assume
as
a
matter
of
course
that
you'll
be
executed
or
sent
to
the
mines
it
will
take
all
my
influence
to
get
you
pardoned
in
exchange
you
can
do
me
a
few
services."
his
teeth
flashed
white
in
his
beard
"the
first
of
which
can
begin
now!"
"_hm?_"
"i
want
you
to
kill
a
man
for
me."
"well--"
rikard
sat
thinking
a
moment
"who
is
he?"
"i'll
come
to
that
it
nobody
you
know
or
care
about
if
you
fullfil
that
mission
there
will
be
others
and
your
rise
can
be
swift."
"you
turn
me
loose
with
a
sword,"
said
the
barbarian
slowly
"and
expect
me
to
do
just
what
you
want?"
"naturally,"
said
rayth
"i
will
keep
your
charming
lady
as
a
hostage."
he
smiled
on
leda
and
a
slow
hot
flush
crept
up
her
cheeks
and
stained
her
breast
"i
shall
see
that
she
is
not
bored."





with
a
shave
and
a
haircut
a
decent
tunic
and
a
sword
at
his
waist
and
a
feather-cap
tilted
rakishly
over
one
ear
rikard
could
pass
for
anyone
but
the
hunted
rebel
of
nyrac--a
young
guardsman
off
duty
perhaps
recruited
from
some
recently
conquered
province
and
swaggering
into
the
civilization
which
had
swallowed
his
people
he
drew
no
special
attention
as
he
pushed
through
the
crowded
hubbub
of
the
city
except
from
an
occasional
bold-eyed
maiden
toward
the
north
side
of
the
dome
roughly
at
ground
level
was
the
area
of
those
who
were
more
than
simple
freemen
without
being
quite
nobles--merchants
shopkeepers
independent
artisans
of
all
kinds
moving
through
that
district
rikard
was
struck
by
the
bearing
of
the
folk
neither
servile
nor
haughty
neither
uncouth
nor
overly
mannered
a
more
civilized
version
of
the
barbarians'
egalitarianism
it
occurred
to
him
that
this
class
was
an
element
which
had
entered
into
no
one
calculations
but
he
had
a
mission
and
the
farther
he
went
the
more
desperate
it
began
to
seem
there
little
choice
he
thought
grayly
if
i'd
refused
he'd
have
had
me
slain
then
and
there
but
that
i
who
was
chief
over
the
freemen
of
nyrac
should
sink
to
be
rayth
assassin
kill
the
chief
engineer
of
coper
city
rayth
had
shown
him
the
layout
warned
him
that
the
temple
had
its
own
guards
and
said
that
several
of
his
men
had
attempted
the
job
before
and
failed
bloodily
on
the
other
hand
could
he
but
accomplish
his
task
and
fight
his
way
out
of
the
temple
there'd
be
a
gang
of
the
prince
bully
boys
waiting
to
escort
him
home
rikard
had
pulled
off
more
daring
stunts
than
this
as
to
why
the
old
man
should
be
murdered
rayth
had
said
little
except
that
he
stood
in
the
way
of
certain
plans
and
rikard
who
had
small
tenderness
for
any
copers
didn't
inquire
further
he
cast
a
glance
behind
him
now
and
again
as
he
thrust
through
the
crowds
which
swarmed
and
eddied
around
bazaars
taverns
and
playhouses
and
once
or
twice
thought
he
glimpsed
a
couple
of
the
prince
hard-faced
personal
guards
lounging
inconspicuously
after
him--but
he
wasn't
sure
the
mob
was
too
much
a
blend
of
every
element
in
luna
a
richly
dressed
pot-bellied
merchant
borne
in
a
litter
by
four
slaves
a
pair
of
gay
young
warriors
staggering
out
of
a
tavern
compartment
a
hawker
shrieking
his
wares
where
two
corridors
ran
together
a
wondering
leather-clad
barbarian
a
fantastically
painted
strolling
player
thrumming
his
harp
and
grinning
at
the
girls
as
they
went
by
a
humble
gray
worker
a
serious-faced
young
engineer
his
long
red
robes
swirling
about
him--it
was
a
gay
and
noisy
throng
a
whirl
of
life
and
color
and
rikard
could
not
altogether
suppress
an
answering
smile
there
was
nothing
like
this
in
the
poor
little
outlier
towns
he
came
from
the
passageway
to
a
broad
grassy
plaza
and
felt
a
sudden
tightening
of
his
muscles
and
a
rising
throb
in
his
breast
beyond
it
there
was
a
great
wall
reaching
the
height
of
many
levels
porticoed
and
velvet-hung
with
the
sign
of
holy
earth
inlaid
above
the
door
the
temple
it
was
past
time
for
services
and
few
people
were
in
sight
before
the
wall--mostly
acolytes
hurrying
on
their
various
tasks
and
six
temple
guardsmen
standing
rock-stiff
in
gilt
breast-plates
and
plumed
helmets
before
the
looming
gate
rikard
stood
for
a
moment
studying
them
the
long
pikes
and
the
swords
at
their
hips
and
wondered
how
many
more
there
were
inside
the
sacred
precincts
he
drew
a
deep
breath
filling
his
nostrils
with
the
cool
rich
scent
of
grass
and
flowering
shrubs
for
perhaps
the
final
time
well--leda
was
still
rayth
hostage
he
shook
himself
straightened
his
back
and
walked
boldly
up
to
the
gate
two
pikes
slanted
across
his
path
"hold
what
do
you
wish?"
"i
have
to
see
the
chief
engineer."
"this
is
not
the
time
for
audiences
come
back
after
the
sunrise
ceremonies."
"it
won't
keep
i
bear
special
news
from
the
lands-that-see-not-earth."
the
guards
captain
face
lit
with
a
flicker
of
interest
"what
is
it?"
"it
for
the
ears
of
his
wisdom
alone."
"then
wait
your
turn."
"look
here,"
said
rikard
"you
can
send
him
a
message
that
it
concerns
certain
newly
found
ores
of
power
if
his
wisdom
isn't
interested
i'll
go
my
way
but
if
you
don't
do
this
much
i'd
hate
to
be
in
your
skin
when
he
learns
what
you've
kept
from
him."
"hmmm--well--"
the
captain
rubbed
his
chin
there
was
a
superstitious
awe
deep
within
his
eyes
and
the
other
sentries
gaped
"well
all
right."
he
peered
narrowly
at
the
barbarian
"you're
not
of
the
city
where
are
you
from?"
"moonburg
if
you
must
know
but
my
message!"
the
captain
blew
a
whistle
and
an
acolyte
came
forth
from
within
to
receive
the
word
and
run
back
with
it
rikard
stood
waiting
trying
not
to
shiver
with
the
gathering
tautness
of
the
moment
rayth
had
told
him
to
give
this
message
and
it
seemed
to
work
the
prince
had
added
that
the
temple
was
seeking
to
recover
the
lost
secret
of
the
legendary
tommic
power
so
immensely
more
potent
than
the
sunlight
batteries
but
had
not
gone
far
for
lack
of
the
necessary
metals
to
rikard
tommic
had
merely
been
a
local
god
worshipped
by
some
towns
though
in
other
stories
he
was
the
devil
responsible
for
the
fall
"your
sword,"
said
the
captain
rikard
shrugged
it
was
understandable
that
no
visitor
should
bear
weapons
within
the
temple
especially
after
rayth
last
few
attempts
he
unslung
his
glaive
and
handed
it
over
and
permitted
them
to
search
him
for
concealed
knives
it
did
not
seem
to
occur
to
them
in
spite
of
his
hard-thewed
size
that
hands
and
shod
feet
have
killed
men
the
acolyte
returned
a
full
engineer
with
him
the
latter
spoke
hurriedly
"who
are
you
stranger
and
what
is
this
word
you
bear?"
"i
am
atli
athur
son
of
moonburg
your
knowledge,"
said
rikard
bowing
as
low
as
his
stiff-necked
soul
permitted
him
"if
it
please
you
this
word
i
have
should
not
be
discussed
out
in
public."
"no--no--certainly
not
i'll
take
you
to
his
wisdom
follow
me."
rikard
went
after
the
swirling
red
robe
his
narrowed
eyes
taking
careful
note
of
everything
they
passed
down
a
long
muraled
corridor
opening
into
rooms
which
seemed
oddly
little
like
religious
centers--they
glittered
with
metal
and
glass
and
plastic
and
engineers
in
drab
stained
smocks
labored
with
a
bewildering
variety
of
instruments
past
a
couple
of
guardsmen
the
thing
to
do
he
thought
grimly
was
to
break
the
old
fellow
neck
grab
a
sword
from
the
nearest
armed
man
and
try
to
cut
his
way
out
none
of
rayth
men
were
allowed
inside
the
temple
but
if
they
were
waiting
just
beyond
the
gates
he
might
have
some
chance
the
corridor
ended
in
a
tall
doorway
where
four
sentries
in
gold
and
scarlet
stood
by
rigidly
held
pikes
beyond
was
the
great
audience
chamber
it
was
lavishly
furnished
gold
and
jewels
and
velvet
and
the
lovely
ancient
works
the
far
side
was
a
great
sheet
of
plastic
opening
on
the
raw
splendor
of
landscape
and
an
earth
at
the
full
its
eerie
blue
radiance
streaming
in
to
blend
with
the
soft
glow
of
fluorotubes
rikard
had
little
time
for
esthetics
his
gaze
roved
in
search
of
enemies
no
soldiers
in
this
room
and
the
engineer
who
guided
him
was
closing
the
massive
door
on
the
sentries--praise
the
gods
it
gave
him
a
chance
to
kill
the
chief
and
burst
out
and
surprise
those
men
about
a
dozen
engineers
stood
around
the
throne
of
wisdom--high-ranking
to
judge
from
their
robes
most
of
them
young
and
burly
not
a
one
of
them
bearing
sword
or
dagger
rikard
knelt
before
the
throne
until
a
voice
that
was
almost
a
whisper
said:
"rise
my
son
and
say
your
message."
"thank
you
your
wisdom."
the
rebel
got
up
and
moved
closer
to
the
old
man
who
sat
before
him
a
very
old
man
he
saw
thin
and
stooped
and
frail
with
a
halo
of
white
hair
about
the
gaunt
face
and
the
luminous
eyes
and
the
wonderful
dome
of
a
forehead
for
an
instant
rikard
despised
himself
but
leda
leda
of
the
fair
tresses
and
the
low
sweet
laughter
and
the
undaunted
gallantry
leda
was
hostage
to
rayth
"you
brought
word
of
ores
of
power
found
on
the
far
side
of
luna,"
said
the
chief
engineer
he
pursed
his
lips
and
tapped
his
knee
with
the
jeweled
slide
rule
of
his
office
"but
how
would
the
heathen
there
know
what
to
look
for?"
"they
weren't
looking
for
anything
your
wisdom,"
replied
rikard
he
stood
some
five
feet
away--one
easy
jump
"it
was
a
certain
engineer-educated
trader
from
this
city
borsu
by
name
who
several
years
ago
was
captured
by
moonburg
men
attacking
a
caravan
of
his
i
had
him
for
slave
but
he
was
so
bold
and
wise
a
man
that
soon
we
were
more
friends
than
master
and
servant
and
it
was
he
who
organized
an
expedition
to
the
heathen
lands
he
thought
their
ores
which
we
on
earthside
have
little
exploited
could
be
obtained
for
our
manufactured
goods
at
a
fine
profit
and
sold
here
in
coper
city
it
was
he
who
saw
those
deposits
and
had
them
mined
on
our
return
we
found
that
moonburg
had
been
brought
under
your
city
rule
but
nevertheless--"
they
were
relaxing
their
wariness
intent
on
his
account
"--we
thought
that
we
could
still
do
business
especially
with
the
temple
as
borsu
was
ill
i
left
him
in
moonburg
and
came
myself
to--"





he
hit
the
chief
engineer
with
a
smack
of
bodies
and
his
hands
closed
around
the
thin
neck
thunder
and
stars
exploded
in
his
skull
he
reeled
aside
falling
to
the
ground
and
the
engineer
rushed
on
him
with
the
club
he
had
pulled
from
his
long
sleeve
rikard
kicked
out
and
the
coper
flew
backward
grunting
the
barbarian
snarled
and
lurched
to
his
feet
swords
and
daggers
gleamed
as
the
others
yanked
them
from
concealment
trapped
they
weren't
stupid
these
engineers
and
now
he
was
trapped
rikard
hurled
himself
forward
in
a
flying
tackle
hit
the
nearest
man
and
rolled
over
on
the
floor
with
him
wrenching
the
fellow
dagger
loose
he
bounded
back
to
his
feet
and
rushed
another
engineer
"alive!"
screamed
the
old
man
"take
him
alive!"
for
the
torture
cells--no
rikard
closed
with
the
engineer
stabbing
him
in
the
shoulder
before
he
could
slash
with
his
sword
he
pulled
the
glaive
loose
and
backed
toward
the
wall
growling
sword
in
one
hand
and
dagger
in
the
other
the
men
formed
a
defensive
line
around
their
chief
and
brandished
their
blades
the
wounded
engineer
rose
suddenly
and
sprinted
for
the
door
rikard
threw
the
knife
after
him
missed
and
groaned
as
the
door
was
swung
wide
and
the
four
guardsmen
entered
"ha
nyrac!"
he
yelled
and
threw
himself
upon
them
his
sword
whistled
clanged
off
the
metal
shaft
of
the
nearest
pike
and
raked
the
cuirass
beyond
another
guard
hit
him
with
the
butt
of
his
pike
and
he
staggered
now
the
blows
rained
on
him
smashing
thunder
of
violence
and
lightning-shot
darkness
the
sword
fell
from
his
hand
and
he
toppled
still
cursing
someone
kicked
him
as
he
fell
he
lay
there
half
conscious
mumbling
through
a
mask
of
blood
while
they
bound
him
when
the
reeling
and
the
blurring
ended
and
only
the
thumping
pain
and
the
slow
drip
of
red
were
left
he
sat
up
and
glared
at
them
where
they
stood
around
him
"i
thought
rayth
was
wiser
than
that,"
muttered
an
engineer
"it
wasn't
a
bad
trick."
the
old
man
fingered
his
throat
with
a
wry
smile
"he
almost
made
it
but
who
are
you
so
bold
as
to
go
alone
and
unarmed
in
war
against
the
temple?"





rikard
shook
his
ringing
head
the
sickness
in
him
was
as
much
from
stupefied
dismay
as
from
his
hurts
that
he
should
have
failed--that
he
should
have
been
captured
and
bound
like
a
pig
for
slaughter
the
second
time
"hm--now
let
me
think."
the
chief
engineer
stroked
his
chin
"obviously
rayth
would
only
have
tried
this
with
an
assassin
so
bold
and
strong
that
there
would
be
some
chance
of
success
and
at
the
same
time
one
over
whom
he
had
enough
of
a
hold
to
drive
him
to
this
desperate
mission
now
it
is
only
ten
or
fifteen
hours
since
we
heard
that
the
mighty
rikard
of
nyrac
had
been
captured
by
this
same
rayth."
"rikard
of
nyrac--aye
your
wisdom
they
said
he
was
big
and
dark
it
must
be
he
right?"
a
foot
kicked
the
prisoner
"gently
wanno
gently
there
is
no
cause
to
maltreat
him
when
he
is
helpless
nobody
was
killed
in
this
little
affair."
the
chief
engineer
stooped
over
rikard
and
smiled
"see
here
my
friend
i
have
no
ill
will
for
you
i've
chuckled
for
a
long
time
over
your
impudent
bearding
of
the
coper
lords
and
i
wouldn't
mind
doing
you
a
good
turn
if
you'd
let
me."
"but
first
i
have
to
do
something
for
you
eh?"
rikard
grinned
without
humor
"it
seems
to
be
a
city
custom."
"be
reasonable
man
you've
failed
your
mission
rayth
will
have
no
further
use
for
you
and
only
here
is
there
protection
i
daresay
you've
no
love
for
rayth
and
he
is
our
greatest
enemy
as
well."
rikard
was
silent
"now
what
reason
did
you
have
to
do
his
foul
work
for
him?
i
cannot
quite
imagine
rikard
of
nyrac
turning
assassin
for
hire."
"they
say
a
woman
was
captured
with
him
your
wisdom,"
said
one
of
the
engineers
thoughtfully
"ah
so
and
rayth
holds
her
hm."
the
chief
engineer
paced
back
and
forth
the
robes
swirling
around
his
thin
stooped
form
suddenly
he
said:
"bring
this
man
a
bowl
of
wine."
it
was
a
fire
coursing
in
his
veins
the
leaden
haze
lifted
from
his
mind
and
he
looked
at
his
captors
with
cleared
eyes
the
chief
engineer
said
to
him:
"rikard
this
is
the
situation
in
coper
city
the
old
bold
dynasty
of
the
mayors
has
faded
till
the
last
of
them
sits
bibbing
in
his
apartments
with
little
interest
in
anything
save
a
new
wench
meanwhile
the
struggle
for
the
real
power
over
this
growing
empire
lies
between
the
great
nobles
of
whom
rayth
is
chief
and
the
temple
which
recruits
from
all
ranks
and
is
thus
closer
to
the
people
and
more
alive
to
their
wants
the
world
has
come
down
far
since
the
fall
what
was
a
wise
and
glorious
and
adventurous
civilization
has
been
destroyed
and
this
its
successor
is
stagnant
and
cruel
and
ignorant
it
has
done
little
which
was
new
or
decent
in
a
thousand
years
i
do
not
say
that
the
temple
is
blameless
the
early
chief
engineers
found
it
convenient
to
monopolize
what
true
knowledge
was
left
and
to
ally
themselves
with
the
nobles
in
crushing
the
commons
but
in
the
past
generation
we
have
tried
to
make
some
amends
we
have
spoken
against
human
slavery
and
unjust
laws
and
we
would
like
to
teach
all
men
enough
to
make
them
more
than
walking
bellies
temple
and
nobles
agree
that
man
must
be
united--"
rikard
snarled
at
him
"--but
it
is
rather
for
us
to
learn
freedom
from
the
barbarians
in
exchange
for
our
order
and
culture
than
for
them
to
be
enslaved
by
us
and
there
is
a
sharp
split
between
the
parties
furthermore
we
have
tried
to
regain
the
ancient
knowledge
by
the
methods
with
which
it
was
won
in
the
first
place--that
is
by
trying
our
ideas
to
see
if
they
work
rather
than
by
blind
acceptance
of
ancient
authority
you
must
have
noticed
our
laboratories
as
you
entered
but
this
leads
to
heretical
questioning
of
everything
and
the
nobles
do
not
like
it
"thus
rayth
has
several
times
sought
to
have
me
assassinated
there
is
little
i
can
do
save
guard
against
it--i
would
get
no
satisfaction
in
the
courts
if
he
should
succeed
he
could
use
his
influence
and
very
likely
get
one
of
his
own
hand-picked
engineers
named
to
my
office
for
we--scientists--are
a
small
party
in
the
temple
and
only
the
more
or
less
accidental
fact
that
i
was
converted
to
such
views
shortly
after
assuming
the
slide
rule
has
given
us
our
success
if
we
could
somehow
overcome
him
there
would
be
a
chance
to
make
some
improvement
in
human
life
perhaps
even
to
reach
earth
eventually
if
we
fail
as
seems
all
too
probable
the
long
night
will
descend
completely."
he
stopped
and
there
was
a
moment
silence
in
the
great
chamber
then
rikard
said:
"i
suppose
you're
telling
me
more
or
less
the
truth
i
don't
really
care
one
way
or
the
other
but
why?
what
do
you
want
of
me?"
"i
don't
know,"
said
the
chief
engineer
frankly
"i
really
don't
know
whether
it
wouldn't
be
safer
all
around
just
to
return
your
head
to
rayth
but--rikard
the
temple
has
been
at
one
grave
disadvantage
its
younger
men
are
often
doughty
fighters
as
you
have
seen
but
they
are
still
mostly
technicians
intellectuals
people
without
practical
experience
in
warfare
you
on
the
other
hand
have
fought
all
your
life
if
you
have
any
suggestions
they
will
be
carefully
considered."
"and
what
do
i
get
from
this?"
"your
life
of
course
and
your
freedom
likewise
your
woman
if
we
can
save
her
we
can
talk
later
of
other
rewards
you
may
find
it
worthwhile
to
work
with
us."
rikard
leaned
back
against
the
wall
letting
his
mind
slide
over
the
facts
and
the
chances
presently
he
nodded
his
blood-matted
head
and
began
to
talk





the
temple
gate
burst
open
and
the
big
man
shot
out
in
a
flying
leap
that
carried
him
over
the
heads
of
the
sentries
to
land
on
the
plaza
grass
a
spear
flew
after
him
he
grabbed
it
and
whirled
about
and
threw
it
back
"stop
him!"
roared
an
engineer
"kill
him
he
killed
the
chief!"
the
guards
sprang
at
rikard
yelling
and
others
boiled
out
of
the
temple
in
their
wake
he
was
already
fleeing
toward
the
corridor
beyond
a
shrieking
laborer
sought
to
bring
him
down--he
kicked
the
man
in
the
teeth
beat
another
aside
with
the
flat
of
his
sword
and
pushed
a
way
into
the
suddenly
milling
throng
half
a
dozen
armed
men
were
around
him
blades
flashing
out
one
grinned
savagely
in
his
beard
"we
thought
you
were
dead,"
he
gasped
"you
were
in
there
so
long--"
"we'll
all
be
dead
if
we
don't
get
out
of
here,"
snapped
rikard
the
raging
temple
warriors
were
crowding
through
the
press
of
humanity
toward
them
and
from
the
swirling
mob
there
seemed
to
rise
one
great
groan
"_the
chief
is
dead
the
chief
is
dead
they
killed
him
the
dirty
murdering
nobles_--"
the
old
fellow
claim
to
be
beloved
of
the
people
was
not
a
lie
thought
rikard
tautly
and
crammed
a
fist
into
the
mouth
of
the
nearest
man
who
rushed
weeping
and
cursing
at
him
swords
and
pikes
clattered
together
as
the
guards
hit
the
tight
circle
of
rayth
warriors
rikard
led
the
retreat
his
sword
whistling
and
thumping--he
did
not
cut
but
he
hammered
a
way
through
the
mob
and
it
fell
back
before
his
great
bloody
shape
"the
ramp--over
there--"
they
braced
themselves
and
leaped
ten
feet
straight
up
arcing
forward
to
land
on
the
upward-curving
surface
then
they
ran
a
hurled
spear
flashed
and
one
of
rayth
men
toppled
two
more
had
been
pulled
down
by
the
bare
hands
of
the
commons
and
another
had
fallen
in
the
retreat
the
crowd
half
angry
half
frightened
moved
slowly
after
them
they
dashed
into
a
corridor
on
the
noble
level
and
the
two
city
guardsmen
posted
there
clanged
the
gate
shut
in
the
face
of
pursuit
panting
they
stopped
and
looked
at
each
other
"there'll
be
mars
to
pay
down
there,"
said
the
leader
hoarsely
"riots--"
"take
me
to
his
excellency,"
said
rikard
"aye--at
once--and
good
work
barbarian
you
did
a
job
that
we've
tried
to
do
for
the
past
five
years."
they
went
swiftly
down
the
long
passageways
up
ramps
and
stairs
past
the
sumptuous
apartments
of
the
rich
where
men
and
women
children
and
servants
and
slaves
cowered
at
sight
of
drawn
weapons
and
at
the
faint
rising
noise
of
the
lower
levels
when
they
came
to
rayth
door
they
entered
without
ceremony
the
prince
leaped
to
his
feet
spilling
his
wine-glass
and
the
lean
bearded
face
blazed
at
rikard
"is
it
done?"
he
yelled
"did
you
really
do
it?"
"aye--aye--"
the
rebel
leaned
wearily
on
his
sword
and
let
his
eyes
rove
the
chamber
there
were
seven
or
eight
other
men
seated
around
the
table
mostly
older
and
fatter
than
rayth
but
all
with
the
rich
dress
and
the
inbred
hauteur
of
the
rulers
there
was
also
a
high-ranking
engineer
a
sly-faced
elderly
man
whose
heavy-lidded
eyes
barely
flicked
over
the
newcomers
before
retreating
back
to
their
own
dreams
but
it
was
to
leda
that
rikard
gaze
went
first
leda
who
had
been
sprawling
sullen
and
splendid
on
a
couch
and
who
now
started
up
and
ran
to
him
and
clung
wordlessly
to
his
bleeding
form
"aye
he
dead,"
nodded
the
barbarian
"it
took
you
several
hours,"
said
rayth
"i
was
sure
you
had
failed."
"they
made
me
wait
a
long
time
while
the
chief
finished
an--an
experiment
they
called
it
but
i
got
at
him
broke
his
neck
and
grabbed
a
sword
and
chopped
my
way
out."
rikard
strode
boldly
over
to
the
table
and
grabbed
up
a
glass
and
drained
it
"do
you
hear
that?"
rayth
turned
on
the
others
and
his
voice
rose
to
a
shout
"do
you
hear
that?"
his
laughter
was
loud
and
wild
"he
dead
his
wisdom
laon
xiii
chief
engineer
of
coper
city
is
dead
are
you
ready
to
assume
the
post
jastur?"
he
cried
to
the
engineer
"would
you
like
to
take
the
name
of
laon
xiv?"
"it
might
be
a
good
idea
to
wait
for
some
confirmation,"
said
the
other
imperturbably
rayth
paced
the
chamber
restlessly
eyes
smoldering
and
the
guests
muttered
to
each
other
rikard
and
leda
paid
no
attention
they
were
holding
close
and
his
hands
and
lips
caressed
her
with
a
new
and
desperate
tenderness
someone
else
entered
a
strong
young
acolyte
who
saluted
and
said
between
gasps
for
air:
"he
dead
sirs
he
been
killed
and
it
mars
down
there
the
commons
are
running
wild!"
there
was
a
knife-slash
across
his
face
blood
dripped
slowly
to
the
red
of
his
gown
"what
did
you
see?"
snapped
rayth
he
sprang
over
and
grabbed
the
acolyte
by
the
shoulders
and
shook
him
"what
did
you
see?"
"i--i
heard
a
great
uproar
in
the
audience
chamber
through
the
closed
doors
that
must
have
been
something
else
though
for
his
wis--old
laon
came
out
and
went
into
a
laboratory
then
some
hours
later
he
returned
to
the
chamber
and--and
presently
there
was
another
noise
louder
and
lasting
longer--then
i
saw
this
man
here
burst
out
knock
down
a
guard
in
his
way
and
go
down
the
hall
i
looked
in--they
were
lying
heaped
in
blood
and
an
engineer
came
in
and
lifted
the
old
man
and
shrieked
that
he
was
dead
then
there
was
panic
everyone
running
guards
fighting
to
get
out
after
the
killer--i
slipped
away
and
came
here
as
you
told
me
sir--"





"dead!"
rayth
shout
echoed
between
the
walls
"dead
d'you
hear?
after
five
years
i've
killed
the
old
swine
and
temple
and
commons
alike
are
rioting--what
more
excuse
do
we
need?"
"excuse?"
whispered
a
noble
"certainly!"
rayth
grinned
"as
a
public-spirited
gesture
we
assemble
our
personal
guards
and
march
them
down
there
to
restore
order
with
the
temple
occupied
by
us
your
election
to
the
slide
rule
becomes
a
certainty
jastur."
"there'll
be
fighting,"
said
the
engineer
nervously
"the
young
engineers
are--were--almost
all
on
his
side
you
know
they
won't
receive
you
kindly--and
then
there
are
the
commons--"
"bah
engineers
and
mobs
against
trained
blades?
certainly
there'll
be
bloodletting
but
it
won't
be
our
blood--at
least
if
we
can
get
down
there
before
they
have
time
to
organize."
rayth
lifted
his
voice
to
a
shout
and
a
guards
officer
stepped
in
and
saluted
there
was
something
like
terror
under
his
hard-held
mask
rayth
snapped
swift
orders
and
he
ran
off
"we'll
unite
all
our
personal
forces,"
said
the
prince
biting
the
words
out
as
he
paced
from
wall
to
wall
"the
mayor
men
and
the
regular
city
guards
aren't
to
be
relied
on
i
wouldn't
be
surprised
if
half
of
them
swung
to
the
temple
side
if
they
get
a
chance
most
of
the
regular
army
is
out
of
the
city
on
garrison
or
combat
duty
and
it
wouldn't
be
too
safe
either
but
between
us
we've
got
three
hundred
trained
bold
men
ready
to
follow
us
down
there."
"_us?_"
squeaked
a
noble
"oh
stay
if
you
want
i'm
going
down!"
rayth
turned
to
clap
rikard
shoulder
"you
too
my
friend
you've
done
well
oh
excellently
well
and
you'll
have
a
rich
reward!"
the
nyracan
shrugged
inwardly
he
was
filled
with
a
sudden
wonder
as
to
whether
he
had
done
the
right
thing
or
not
he
didn't
much
care
really
who
won
they
were
all
copers
to
him--but
the
prince
payment
was
more
certain
and
tangible
than
the
temple
and
too
late
now
he
went
into
the
bathroom
where
leda
washed
and
bandaged
his
hurts
and
whispered
to
him:
"there
is
more
behind
this
than
you
say
my
dearest
i
know
you
too
well."
"aye
there
is
but
i
can't
tell
you
now
stay
close
by
me
and
don't
be
too
surprised
at
anything
i
may
do."
leda
went
back
to
rayth
and
said:
"give
me
a
blade
too."
"you--a
woman?"
he
asked
"i've
sent
more
men
to
earth
than
you
ever
did,"
she
snapped
"from
here
on
rikard
and
i
fight
together."
"well--i
hate
to
risk
such
beauty
being
hacked
up--but
far
be
it
from
me
to
oppose
that
beauty
lightest
wish,"
laughed
the
coper
"remember
though--you'll
be
among
my
own
troops
and
they
don't
take
kindly
to
traitors."
she
smiled
at
him
"how
could
anyone
betray
you?"
she
whispered
"the
oldest
trick
in
the
world,"
sighed
rayth
"and
it
still
works
very
well
take
what
you
wish
from
the
armor
chest
over
there."
she
and
rikard
equipped
themselves
with
weapons--a
sword
for
her
an
ax
for
him--cuirasses
and
helmets
by
that
time
they
could
hear
the
sound
of
marching
feet
rayth
buckled
on
his
own
armor
lifted
his
sword
in
a
mocking
salute
to
his
timorous
comrades
and
walked
out
into
the
hall





it
was
a
strong
and
well-trained
force
filling
the
corridor
with
hard
bodies
and
edged
steel
pikes
and
axes
aloft
raising
a
shout
that
roared
and
boomed
down
the
hall
as
rayth
appeared
he
put
himself
in
the
van
with
the
barbarians
in
the
second
rank
behind
his
and
the
troop
started
off
to
battle
clang
of
booted
feet
slammed
echoing
on
the
metal
floor
rattle
and
clash
of
armor
grim
jests
tossed
from
lip
to
bearded
lip
these
were
the
killers
the
professionals
without
fear
of
man
or
earth
the
trained
elite
which
formed
an
army
within
an
army
and
the
fulcrum
of
the
noble
power
watching
them
marching
with
them
rikard
felt
a
sudden
sick
doubt
within
him
untrained
barbarians
had
toppled
before
this
iron
weapon
they
came
to
the
closed
gate
and
rayth
unlocked
it
and
led
the
way
down
the
ramp
beyond
level
after
level
dropped
past
them
deserted
now
silent
and
empty
but
the
broken
roaring
from
below
had
grown
screaming
its
outrage
screaming
for
blood
when
they
emerged
on
a
landing
at
the
ceiling
of
the
temple
level
and
looked
down
twenty
feet
it
was
to
a
boiling
pool
of
humankind
gray
workers
naked
slaves
velvet
merchants
leather
artisans
women
and
children
howling
and
trampling
until
the
din
shook
the
walls
and
rattled
the
teeth
in
a
man
skull
the
surge
of
white
hating
faces
reached
beyond
vision
mouths
agape
eyes
red
and
running
animal
voices
barking
and
clamoring
rikard
had
never
seen
a
true
mob
before
and
the
elemental
violence
of
it
shook
even
his
calloused
soul
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
regret
the
fact
that
many
of
these
people
must
die
rayth
stood
for
an
instant
stroking
his
beard
thinking
and
then
he
lifted
his
sword
and
sprang
over
the
rail
the
lines
followed
him
jumping
one
by
one
a
dozen
men
simultaneously
floating
down
with
pikes
reaching
beneath
them
they
landed
among
the
mob
hewing
a
clear
way
even
as
they
fell
and
struck
out
the
crowd
surged
back
leaving
red
remnants
underfoot
and
the
troopers
continued
to
leap--forward
ranks
pressing
toward
the
temple
while
the
rearward
lines
were
still
jumping
rayth
blade
whistled
and
butchered
his
face
was
alight
with
a
dark
glee
rikard
and
leda
sandwiched
between
others
could
do
nothing
but
add
the
weight
of
their
bodies
to
the
mass
of
the
troop
the
pack
howled
and
bayed
and
cursed
around
them
missiles
began
to
fly
hammers
ore-lumps
crowbars
wrenches
anvils
hurled
by
brawny
arms
a
guardsman
staggered
and
fell
his
face
cracked
open
another
was
seized
by
the
cloak
dragged
into
a
group
of
women
and
carved
with
butcher
knives
a
third
had
his
pike
snatched
from
him
and
a
big
smith
jabbed
it
into
the
throat
of
a
fourth
before
he
was
killed
the
crowd
gave
way
before
the
ruthlessly
advancing
soldiers
but
it
closed
behind
them
and
filled
the
air
with
noise
and
flying
death
"_they
killed
the
chief!_"
leda
eyes
were
wide
and
her
breast
rose
and
fell
behind
the
binding
corselet
her
voice
came
dimly
to
rikard
under
the
boom
and
howl
of
raw
voices
"they
hate
us!"
"so
they
do."
he
smiled
bleakly
now
the
temple
was
before
them
its
high
wall
looming
over
the
trample
and
clamor
a
thin
line
of
its
own
guards
holding
back
the
rioters
rayth
red
blade
lifted
anew
and
his
bugler
wound
a
single
harsh
note
the
troop
moved
forward
on
the
double
vaguely
rikard
heard
the
prince
calling
to
the
guards
"let
us
through--mayor
order--protect
you--"
"no
one
goes
in--you
bloody
swine!"
the
bugle
screamed
again
and
the
soldiers
locked
ranks
and
charged
swords
and
pikes
clanged
at
the
gate
the
sudden
recoil
hurled
the
rear
lines
backward
rikard
grabbed
leda
flowing
hair
and
pulled
her
ear
close
to
his
lips
and
muttered
swiftly
"listen
we're
with
the
temple
first
chance
you
get
break
free
and
go
over
to
them--once
we're
inside!"
she
clasped
his
hand
briefly
and
then
the
sentries
were
down
and
the
troop
rushed
inside
beyond
was
a
long
narrow
darkness
of
corridor
nothing
stirred
nothing
spoke
they
hastened
through
a
fumbling
gloom
with
only
their
footfalls
and
hoarse
breathing
and
clash
of
metal
for
company
rikard
heard
rayth
voice
puzzled
"where
are
the
others?
the
temple
has
plenty
of
its
own
guardsmen
where
are
they?
has
everyone
fled?"
then
he
laughed
"if
so
why
it
makes
our
task
all
the
easier
forward!"
they
burst
into
the
great
audience
chamber
and
it
was
lighted
and
the
temple
was
waiting
for
them
the
young
engineers
were
reinforced
by
commoners
weapons
in
hand
and
armored
in
spacesuits
the
invaders
let
out
one
roar
and
the
forward
ranks
hurled
spears
that
bounced
off
metal
and
plastic
and
tough
cord
from
the
engineers
arrows
suddenly
darkened
the
air
the
whistling
death
flamed
among
the
soldiers
and
the
lines
sagged
amidst
their
toppling
members
there
was
a
press
from
the
rear
men
driven
forward
and
in
the
instant
bawling
panic
only
rikard
knew
what
it
was--the
temple
guardsmen
aided
perhaps
by
armed
commoners
themselves
throwing
their
power
out
of
the
rooms
and
side
passages
where
it
had
lurked
blocking
the
troop
retreat
and
falling
on
it
from
the
rear
the
line
eddied
and
swirled
about
him
spears
flying
arrows
and
hurled
throwing-axes
the
ranks
of
rayth
buckling
under
pressure
from
both
ends
time
to
get
out
of
here
before
anyone
suspected
that
he
rikard
of
nyrac
had
led
them
into
the
trap
he
turned
on
the
man
beside
him
and
his
ax
hewed
low
shearing
through
flesh
and
bone
of
a
leg
as
the
screaming
warrior
fell
he
brought
his
weapon
up
a
backhanded
blow
crashing
into
the
face
beyond
the
man
behind
him
thrust
from
the
side
he
took
the
spear
on
his
cuirass
and
kneed
viciously
stooping
over
he
undercut
another
of
his
late
companions
and
leda
reached
over
his
back
to
slash
down
the
soldier
beyond
rikard
bent
his
knees
and
leaped
soaring
over
the
fallen
a
dozen
pikes
stabbing
up
after
him
he
hardly
noticed
the
sharp
bright
pain
where
one
raked
his
thigh
he
was
through
their
line
and
leda
was
with
him
they
drifted
down
among
the
engineers





a
big
red-faced
young
man
snarled
behind
his
space
helmet
and
lifted
an
ax
as
rikard
descended
someone
else
grabbed
his
arm
the
helmets
were
left
propped
open
and
his
voice
could
reach
"no
shan
those
are
friends!"
"oh
sorry--i
forgot."
shan
swung
about
and
spattered
the
brains
of
the
nearest
trooper
the
fight
was
now
pressed
into
the
audience
chamber
men
jammed
together
slashing
and
hacking
at
arm
range--there'd
soon
be
more
room
thought
rikard
grimly
and
took
his
place
in
the
engineer
line
the
temple
though
had
order
and
plans
of
a
sort
however
relatively
untrained
its
fighters
were
while
the
invaders
were
broken
up
into
knots
and
fragments
where
their
discipline
could
not
exist
the
important
thing
was
to
hit
them
and
keep
hitting
them
so
they
didn't
get
a
chance
to
reform
his
ax
smote
clanging
off
metal
raking
the
face
and
the
arm
behind
a
blade
hacked
at
him
he
caught
it
on
his
helve
and
turned
the
blow
and
hewed
back
leda
was
beside
him
her
clear
war-cry
raising
as
she
stabbed
and
struck
shan
the
engineer
was
chopping
and
roaring
pious
mottoes
on
his
other
flank:
the
temple
men
pushed
against
the
roiling
soldiers
took
their
blows
on
their
heavier
armor
and
gave
them
back
with
murder
behind
the
clamor
of
men
and
metal
was
a
roar
as
of
sundering
worlds
rayth
was
fighting
like
a
demon
his
blade
whirling
and
shrieking
his
voice
lifted
in
a
rallying-cry
that
drew
his
scattered
followers
together
he
had
courage
thought
rikard
above
the
snarl
of
combat--perhaps
he
was
a
fitter
chief
after
all
but
too
late
now
ha
there
went
another
tumbling
with
his
head
half
off
his
shoulders--so
a
helmet
crumpled
and
the
skull
beneath
it
back
and
forth
the
battle
raged
breaking
and
tearing
ruining
the
chamber
and
the
lives
of
men
and
over
it
lifted
the
great
calm
disc
of
earth
and
the
million
scornful
stars
back
and
forth
trampling
sundering
killing
and
laming
and
rikard
was
painted
with
blood
and
his
arms
grew
weary
from
swinging
the
ax
the
chamber
began
to
clear
as
men
fell
it
was
floored
with
corpses
and
one
had
room
to
cast
a
spear
or
take
a
flying
leap
down
on
the
head
of
an
enemy
the
soldiers
had
suffered
hideously
but
there
were
many
temple
dead
ordinary
guardsmen
scantily
armored
commoners
engineers
with
their
spacesuits
pierced
or
their
helmets
cloven
the
fight
was
breaking
into
knots
and
clusters
small
whirlpools
of
murder
swaying
back
and
forth
over
the
great
blood-wet
space
men
springing
through
the
air
at
each
other
it
seemed
to
rikard
as
he
raised
blurred
eyes
toward
holy
earth
that
the
disc
had
grown
noticeably
gibbous--had
they
fought
that
long?
"over
here
stand
and
fight
men
of
coper!"
it
was
rayth
backed
into
a
corner
above
a
high
heap
of
fallen
temple
men
foremost
in
a
grim
and
haggard
line
of
troopers
hurling
back
wave
after
wave
rikard
shook
his
head
a
sudden
dark
sense
of
destiny
on
him
and
moved
across
the
floor
with
lifted
ax
"you,"
said
rayth
very
softly
"you--the
triple
turncoat--"
suddenly
he
threw
back
his
head
and
laughter
pulsed
in
his
throat
"oh
it
was
lovely
man
lovely
i
never
thought
you
had
that
kind
of
brains
shall
we
play
the
game
out?"
he
stepped
from
his
line
tossing
his
sword
and
catching
it
again
kissed
his
hand
to
leda
and
fell
into
an
alert
position
before
rikard
the
barbarian
growled
squared
off
and
fell
on
him
rayth
danced
aside
from
the
shrieking
ax
and
his
blade
whipped
in
against
rikard
throat
the
rebel
rolled
barely
ducking
the
thrust
and
rayth
grinned
without
much
malice
and
sprang
at
him
his
sword
clattered
and
yelled
biting
the
nyracan
arms
bouncing
off
the
hard-held
guard
to
sing
around
his
opponent
ears
rikard
fell
back
grunting
in
surprise
and
rayth
pursued
him
lightfooted
leaping
playing
with
him
scream
and
clangor
of
steel
hoarse
gasps
for
breath
bounding
human
forms
in
a
strange
and
terrible
grace
of
murder
clash
and
bite
and
two
faces
staring
into
each
other
eyes
across
the
web
of
flying
metal
rikard
hewed
out
again
and
again
cleaving
empty
air
his
phantom
enemy
was
somewhere
else
to
rake
him
until
he
staggered
and
splashed
his
blood
on
the
floor
leda
yelled
and
sprang
on
rayth
from
behind
his
sword
whirled
around
caught
in
the
guard
of
hers
and
sent
it
spinning
free
and
slewed
back
to
meet
rikard
charge
he
retreated
before
the
rebel
rush
laughing
parrying
blow
after
clumsy
blow
waiting
for
the
end





it
came
swiftly
rikard
bull
charge
forced
rayth
back
into
a
corner
where
he
braced
himself
and
smiled
as
the
ax
whirred
down
toward
his
skull
he
lifted
his
blade
to
parry
it
as
he
had
done
before--and
the
steel
broke
across
rikard
stood
gasping
reeling
on
his
feet
looking
down
at
the
body
of
his
foe
with
a
numbness
stealing
over
him
he
hardly
noticed
the
sobbing
girl
who
flung
herself
into
his
arms
he
stood
mute
for
a
long
while
and
when
he
spoke
at
last
it
was
dully
"that
wasn't
right
i
didn't
kill
him--a
flaw
in
his
blade
did--it
isn't
right
somehow."
the
chief
engineer
came
to
rikard
where
he
stood
watching
the
first
harsh
glare
of
sunrise
creep
over
the
heights
of
copernicus
the
barbarian
leaned
heavily
on
his
woman
he
had
taken
many
hurts





laon
old
face
was
drawn
with
weariness
there
was
no
great
triumph
in
him
"it
over,"
he
said
"it
was
a
bloody
horrible
business
but
we
hold
the
entire
city
now
all
levels
the
nobles
are
our
prisoners
and
the
mayor
is
our
puppet
and
the
temple
is
victorious
thanks
to
you
my
friend."
"there
is
more
to
do,"
said
rikard
"the
armies
will
hear
about
this
out
in
the
conquered
provinces
and
many
of
them
at
least
won't
like
it
there'll
be
hard
fighting
to
hold
what
we
have."
"oh
yes
though
i
think
with
some
diplomacy
and
with
the
provinces
restless
at
their
backs
they
may
decide--well
we
must
see
and
afterward
there
is
much
more
to
do
generations
of
work--are
you
with
us
rikard?"
"i
suppose
so
i'll
have
to
think
about
it
nyrac
should
not
be
a
mere
province
but--well--i'll
think
about
it."
"at
least,"
said
laon
"we
can
rest
a
little
while
now."
"it
over
darling
darling,"
whispered
leda
"the
fight
is
over."
rikard
held
her
close
but
he
was
thinking
of
the
armies
beyond
the
city
and
the
restlessness
of
the
conquered
towns
and
the
ruthless
will
of
those
still
free
of
the
long
task
of
raising
men
turned
into
brutes
by
centuries
of
injustice
and
oppression
of
making
them
free
and
fit
to
use
their
freedom
and
of
all
the
evil
elements
which
would
be
seeking
to
thwart
that
goal
of
the
still
greater
war
to
be
fought
by
quiet
men
in
the
temple
the
war
to
regain
the
lost
wisdom
of
the
ancients
the
battle
which
would
hammer
out
the
long
road
back
to
earth
"no
leda,"
he
said
very
softly
"it
just
beginning."
