preface
the
present
book
embodies
a
study
of
some
aspects
of
western
culture
during
the
past
three
centuries
in
so
far
as
it
has
been
influenced
by
the
development
of
science
this
study
has
been
guided
by
the
conviction
that
the
mentality
of
an
epoch
springs
from
the
view
of
the
world
which
is
in
fact
dominant
in
the
educated
sections
of
the
communities
in
question
there
may
be
more
than
one
such
scheme
corresponding
to
cultural
divisions
the
various
human
interests
which
suggest
cosmologies
and
also
are
influenced
by
them
are
science
aesthetics
ethics
religion
in
every
age
each
of
these
topics
suggests
a
view
of
the
world
in
so
far
as
the
same
set
of
people
are
swayed
by
all
or
more
than
one
of
these
interests
their
effective
outlook
will
be
the
joint
production
from
these
sources
but
each
age
has
it
dominant
preoccupation
and
during
the
three
centuries
in
question
the
cosmology
derived
from
science
has
been
asserting
itself
at
the
expense
of
older
points
of
view
with
their
origins
elsewhere
men
can
be
provincial
in
time
as
well
as
in
place
we
may
ask
ourselves
whether
the
scientific
mentality
of
the
modern
world
in
the
immediate
past
is
not
a
successful
example
of
such
provincial
limitation
philosophy
in
one
of
its
functions
is
the
critic
of
cosmologies
it
is
its
function
to
harmonise
refashion
and
justify
divergent
intuitions
as
to
the
nature
of
things
it
has
to
insist
on
the
scrutiny
of
the
ultimate
ideas
and
on
the
retention
of
the
whole
of
the
evidence
in
shaping
our
cosmological
scheme
its
business
is
to
render
explicit
andâ€”so
far
as
may
beâ€”efficient
a
process
which
otherwise
is
unconsciously
performed
without
rational
tests
bearing
this
in
mind
i
have
avoided
the
introduction
of
a
variety
of
abstruse
detail
respecting
scientific
advance
what
is
wanted
and
what
i
have
striven
after
is
a
sympathetic
study
of
main
ideas
as
seen
from
the
inside
if
my
view
of
the
function
of
philosophy
is
correct
it
is
the
most
effective
of
all
the
intellectual
pursuits
it
builds
cathedrals
before
the
workmen
have
moved
a
stone
and
it
destroys
them
before
the
elements
have
worn
down
their
arches
it
is
the
architect
of
the
buildings
of
the
spirit
and
it
is
also
their
solvent:â€”and
the
spiritual
precedes
the
material
philosophy
works
slowly
thoughts
lie
dormant
for
ages
and
then
almost
suddenly
as
it
were
mankind
finds
that
they
have
embodied
themselves
in
institutions
this
book
in
the
main
consists
of
a
set
of
eight
lowell
lectures
delivered
in
the
february
of
1925
these
lectures
with
some
slight
expansion
and
the
subdivision
of
one
lecture
into
chapters
vii
and
viii
are
here
printed
as
delivered
but
some
additional
matter
has
been
added
so
as
to
complete
the
thought
of
the
book
on
a
scale
which
could
not
be
included
within
that
lecture
course
of
this
new
matter
the
second
chapterâ€”â€˜mathematics
as
an
element
in
the
history
of
thoughtâ€™â€”was
delivered
as
a
lecture
before
the
mathematical
society
of
brown
university
providence
r
i
and
the
twelfth
chapterâ€”â€˜religion
and
scienceâ€™â€”formed
an
address
delivered
in
the
phillips
brooks
house
at
harvard
and
is
to
be
published
in
the
august
number
of
the
atlantic
monthly
of
this
year
1925
the
tenth
and
eleventh
chaptersâ€”â€˜abstractionâ€™
and
â€˜godâ€™â€”are
additions
which
now
appear
for
the
first
time
but
the
book
represents
one
train
of
thought
and
the
antecedent
utilisation
of
some
of
its
contents
is
a
subsidiary
point
there
has
been
no
occasion
in
the
text
to
make
detailed
reference
to
lloyd
morganâ€™s
emergent
evolution
or
to
alexanderâ€™s
space
time
and
deity
it
will
be
obvious
to
readers
that
i
have
found
them
very
suggestive
i
am
especially
indebted
to
alexanderâ€™s
great
work
the
wide
scope
of
the
present
book
makes
it
impossible
to
acknowledge
in
detail
the
various
sources
of
information
or
of
ideas
the
book
is
the
product
of
thought
and
reading
in
past
years
which
were
not
undertaken
with
any
anticipation
of
utilisation
for
the
present
purpose
accordingly
it
would
now
be
impossible
for
me
to
give
reference
to
my
sources
for
details
even
if
it
were
desirable
so
to
do
but
there
is
no
need:
the
facts
which
are
relied
upon
are
simple
and
well
known
on
the
philosophical
side
any
consideration
of
epistemology
has
been
entirely
excluded
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
discuss
that
topic
without
upsetting
the
whole
balance
of
the
work
the
key
to
the
book
is
the
sense
of
the
overwhelming
importance
of
a
prevalent
philosophy
my
most
grateful
thanks
are
due
to
my
colleague
mr
raphael
demos
for
reading
the
proofs
and
for
the
suggestion
of
many
improvements

chapter
i
the
origins
of
modern
science
the
progress
of
civilisation
is
not
wholly
a
uniform
drift
towards
better
things
it
may
perhaps
wear
this
aspect
if
we
map
it
on
a
scale
which
is
large
enough
but
such
broad
views
obscure
the
details
on
which
rest
our
whole
understanding
of
the
process
new
epochs
emerge
with
comparative
suddenness
if
we
have
regard
to
the
scores
of
thousands
of
years
throughout
which
the
complete
history
extends
secluded
races
suddenly
take
their
places
in
the
main
stream
of
events:
technological
discoveries
transform
the
mechanism
of
human
life:
a
primitive
art
quickly
flowers
into
full
satisfaction
of
some
aesthetic
craving:
great
religions
in
their
crusading
youth
spread
through
the
nations
the
peace
of
heaven
and
the
sword
of
the
lord
the
sixteenth
century
of
our
era
saw
the
disruption
of
western
christianity
and
the
rise
of
modern
science
it
was
an
age
of
ferment
nothing
was
settled
though
much
was
openedâ€”new
worlds
and
new
ideas
in
science
copernicus
and
vesalius
may
be
chosen
as
representative
figures:
they
typify
the
new
cosmology
and
the
scientific
emphasis
on
direct
observation
giordano
bruno
was
the
martyr
but
the
cause
for
which
he
suffered
was
not
that
of
science
but
that
of
free
imaginative
speculation
his
death
in
the
year
1600
ushered
in
the
first
century
of
modern
science
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
term
in
his
execution
there
was
an
unconscious
symbolism:
for
the
subsequent
tone
of
scientific
thought
has
contained
distrust
of
his
type
of
general
speculativeness
the
reformation
for
all
its
importance
may
be
considered
as
a
domestic
affair
of
the
european
races
even
the
christianity
of
the
east
viewed
it
with
profound
disengagement
furthermore
such
disruptions
are
no
new
phenomena
in
the
history
of
christianity
or
of
other
religions
when
we
project
this
great
revolution
upon
the
whole
history
of
the
christian
church
we
cannot
look
upon
it
as
introducing
a
new
principle
into
human
life
for
good
or
for
evil
it
was
a
great
transformation
of
religion
but
it
was
not
the
coming
of
religion
it
did
not
itself
claim
to
be
so
reformers
maintained
that
they
were
only
restoring
what
had
been
forgotten
it
is
quite
otherwise
with
the
rise
of
modern
science
in
every
way
it
contrasts
with
the
contemporary
religious
movement
the
reformation
was
a
popular
uprising
and
for
a
century
and
a
half
drenched
europe
in
blood
the
beginnings
of
the
scientific
movement
were
confined
to
a
minority
among
the
intellectual
ã©lite
in
a
generation
which
saw
the
thirty
yearsâ€™
war
and
remembered
alva
in
the
netherlands
the
worst
that
happened
to
men
of
science
was
that
galileo
suffered
an
honourable
detention
and
a
mild
reproof
before
dying
peacefully
in
his
bed
the
way
in
which
the
persecution
of
galileo
has
been
remembered
is
a
tribute
to
the
quiet
commencement
of
the
most
intimate
change
in
outlook
which
the
human
race
had
yet
encountered
since
a
babe
was
born
in
a
manger
it
may
be
doubted
whether
so
great
a
thing
has
happened
with
so
little
stir
the
thesis
which
these
lectures
will
illustrate
is
that
this
quiet
growth
of
science
has
practically
recoloured
our
mentality
so
that
modes
of
thought
which
in
former
times
were
exceptional
are
now
broadly
spread
through
the
educated
world
this
new
colouring
of
ways
of
thought
had
been
proceeding
slowly
for
many
ages
in
the
european
peoples
at
last
it
issued
in
the
rapid
development
of
science
and
has
thereby
strengthened
itself
by
its
most
obvious
application
the
new
mentality
is
more
important
even
than
the
new
science
and
the
new
technology
it
has
altered
the
metaphysical
presuppositions
and
the
imaginative
contents
of
our
minds
so
that
now
the
old
stimuli
provoke
a
new
response
perhaps
my
metaphor
of
a
new
colour
is
too
strong
what
i
mean
is
just
that
slightest
change
of
tone
which
yet
makes
all
the
difference
this
is
exactly
illustrated
by
a
sentence
from
a
published
letter
of
that
adorable
genius
william
james
when
he
was
finishing
his
great
treatise
on
the
principles
of
psychology
he
wrote
to
his
brother
henry
james
â€˜i
have
to
forge
every
sentence
in
the
teeth
of
irreducible
and
stubborn
facts.â€™
this
new
tinge
to
modern
minds
is
a
vehement
and
passionate
interest
in
the
relation
of
general
principles
to
irreducible
and
stubborn
facts
all
the
world
over
and
at
all
times
there
have
been
practical
men
absorbed
in
â€˜irreducible
and
stubborn
factsâ€™:
all
the
world
over
and
at
all
times
there
have
been
men
of
philosophic
temperament
who
have
been
absorbed
in
the
weaving
of
general
principles
it
is
this
union
of
passionate
interest
in
the
detailed
facts
with
equal
devotion
to
abstract
generalisation
which
forms
the
novelty
in
our
present
society
previously
it
had
appeared
sporadically
and
as
if
by
chance
this
balance
of
mind
has
now
become
part
of
the
tradition
which
infects
cultivated
thought
it
is
the
salt
which
keeps
life
sweet
the
main
business
of
universities
is
to
transmit
this
tradition
as
a
widespread
inheritance
from
generation
to
generation
another
contrast
which
singles
out
science
from
among
the
european
movements
of
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
is
its
universality
modern
science
was
born
in
europe
but
its
home
is
the
whole
world
in
the
last
two
centuries
there
has
been
a
long
and
confused
impact
of
western
modes
upon
the
civilisation
of
asia
the
wise
men
of
the
east
have
been
puzzling
and
are
puzzling
as
to
what
may
be
the
regulative
secret
of
life
which
can
be
passed
from
west
to
east
without
the
wanton
destruction
of
their
own
inheritance
which
they
so
rightly
prize
more
and
more
it
is
becoming
evident
that
what
the
west
can
most
readily
give
to
the
east
is
its
science
and
its
scientific
outlook
this
is
transferable
from
country
to
country
and
from
race
to
race
wherever
there
is
a
rational
society
in
this
course
of
lectures
i
shall
not
discuss
the
details
of
scientific
discovery
my
theme
is
the
energising
of
a
state
of
mind
in
the
modern
world
its
broad
generalisations
and
its
impact
upon
other
spiritual
forces
there
are
two
ways
of
reading
history
forwards
and
backwards
in
the
history
of
thought
we
require
both
methods
a
climate
of
opinionâ€”to
use
the
happy
phrase
of
a
seventeenth
century
writerâ€”requires
for
its
understanding
the
consideration
of
its
antecedents
and
its
issues
accordingly
in
this
lecture
i
shall
consider
some
of
the
antecedents
of
our
modern
approach
to
the
investigation
of
nature
in
the
first
place
there
can
be
no
living
science
unless
there
is
a
widespread
instinctive
conviction
in
the
existence
of
an
order
of
things
and
in
particular
of
an
order
of
nature
i
have
used
the
word
instinctive
advisedly
it
does
not
matter
what
men
say
in
words
so
long
as
their
activities
are
controlled
by
settled
instincts
the
words
may
ultimately
destroy
the
instincts
but
until
this
has
occurred
words
do
not
count
this
remark
is
important
in
respect
to
the
history
of
scientific
thought
for
we
shall
find
that
since
the
time
of
hume
the
fashionable
scientific
philosophy
has
been
such
as
to
deny
the
rationality
of
science
this
conclusion
lies
upon
the
surface
of
humeâ€™s
philosophy
take
for
example
the
following
passage
from
section
iv
of
his
inquiry
concerning
human
understanding_:
â€œin
a
word
then
every
effect
is
a
distinct
event
from
its
cause
it
could
not
therefore
be
discovered
in
the
cause
and
the
first
invention
or
conception
of
it
ã
priori
must
be
entirely
arbitrary.â€
if
the
cause
in
itself
discloses
no
information
as
to
the
effect
so
that
the
first
invention
of
it
must
be
entirely
arbitrary
it
follows
at
once
that
science
is
impossible
except
in
the
sense
of
establishing
entirely
arbitrary
connections
which
are
not
warranted
by
anything
intrinsic
to
the
natures
either
of
causes
or
effects
some
variant
of
humeâ€™s
philosophy
has
generally
prevailed
among
men
of
science
but
scientific
faith
has
risen
to
the
occasion
and
has
tacitly
removed
the
philosophic
mountain
in
view
of
this
strange
contradiction
in
scientific
thought
it
is
of
the
first
importance
to
consider
the
antecedents
of
a
faith
which
is
impervious
to
the
demand
for
a
consistent
rationality
we
have
therefore
to
trace
the
rise
of
the
instinctive
faith
that
there
is
an
order
of
nature
which
can
be
traced
in
every
detailed
occurrence
of
course
we
all
share
in
this
faith
and
we
therefore
believe
that
the
reason
for
the
faith
is
our
apprehension
of
its
truth
but
the
formation
of
a
general
ideaâ€”such
as
the
idea
of
the
order
of
natureâ€”
and
the
grasp
of
its
importance
and
the
observation
of
its
exemplification
in
a
variety
of
occasions
are
by
no
means
the
necessary
consequences
of
the
truth
of
the
idea
in
question
familiar
things
happen
and
mankind
does
not
bother
about
them
it
requires
a
very
unusual
mind
to
undertake
the
analysis
of
the
obvious
accordingly
i
wish
to
consider
the
stages
in
which
this
analysis
became
explicit
and
finally
became
unalterably
impressed
upon
the
educated
minds
of
western
europe
obviously
the
main
recurrences
of
life
are
too
insistent
to
escape
the
notice
of
the
least
rational
of
humans
and
even
before
the
dawn
of
rationality
they
have
impressed
themselves
upon
the
instincts
of
animals
it
is
unnecessary
to
labour
the
point
that
in
broad
outline
certain
general
states
of
nature
recur
and
that
our
very
natures
have
adapted
themselves
to
such
repetitions
but
there
is
a
complementary
fact
which
is
equally
true
and
equally
obvious:â€”nothing
ever
really
recurs
in
exact
detail
no
two
days
are
identical
no
two
winters
what
has
gone
has
gone
forever
accordingly
the
practical
philosophy
of
mankind
has
been
to
expect
the
broad
recurrences
and
to
accept
the
details
as
emanating
from
the
inscrutable
womb
of
things
beyond
the
ken
of
rationality
men
expected
the
sun
to
rise
but
the
wind
bloweth
where
it
listeth
certainly
from
the
classical
greek
civilisation
onwards
there
have
been
men
and
indeed
groups
of
men
who
have
placed
themselves
beyond
this
acceptance
of
an
ultimate
irrationality
such
men
have
endeavoured
to
explain
all
phenomena
as
the
outcome
of
an
order
of
things
which
extends
to
every
detail
geniuses
such
as
aristotle
or
archimedes
or
roger
bacon
must
have
been
endowed
with
the
full
scientific
mentality
which
instinctively
holds
that
all
things
great
and
small
are
conceivable
as
exemplifications
of
general
principles
which
reign
throughout
the
natural
order
but
until
the
close
of
the
middle
ages
the
general
educated
public
did
not
feel
that
intimate
conviction
and
that
detailed
interest
in
such
an
idea
so
as
to
lead
to
an
unceasing
supply
of
men
with
ability
and
opportunity
adequate
to
maintain
a
coordinated
search
for
the
discovery
of
these
hypothetical
principles
either
people
were
doubtful
about
the
existence
of
such
principles
or
were
doubtful
about
any
success
in
finding
them
or
took
no
interest
in
thinking
about
them
or
were
oblivious
to
their
practical
importance
when
found
for
whatever
reason
search
was
languid
if
we
have
regard
to
the
opportunities
of
a
high
civilisation
and
the
length
of
time
concerned
why
did
the
pace
suddenly
quicken
in
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries?
at
the
close
of
the
middle
ages
a
new
mentality

greek

what
the
ancients
had
discovered
finally
although
in
the
year
1500
europe
knew
less
than
archimedes
who
died
in
the
year
212
b
c
yet
in
the
year
1700
newtonâ€™s
principia
had
been
written
and
the
world
was
well
started
on
the
modern
epoch
there
have
been
great
civilisations
in
which
the
peculiar
balance
of
mind
required
for
science
has
only
fitfully
appeared
and
has
produced
the
feeblest
result
for
example
the
more
we
know
of
chinese
art
of
chinese
literature
and
of
the
chinese
philosophy
of
life
the
more
we
admire
the
heights
to
which
that
civilization
attained
for
thousands
of
years
there
have
been
in
china
acute
and
learned
men
patiently
devoting
their
lives
to
study
having
regard
to
the
span
of
time
and
to
the
population
concerned
china
forms
the
largest
volume
of
civilisation
which
the
world
has
seen
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
the
intrinsic
capacity
of
individual
chinamen
for
the
pursuit
of
science
and
yet
chinese
science
is
practically
negligible
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
china
if
left
to
itself
would
have
ever
produced
any
progress
in
science
the
same
may
be
said
of
india
furthermore
if
the
persians
had
enslaved
the
greeks
there
is
no
definite
ground
for
belief
that
science
would
have
flourished
in
europe
the
romans
showed
no
particular
originality
in
that
line
even
as
it
was
the
greeks
though
they
founded
the
movement
did
not
sustain
it
with
the
concentrated
interest
which
modern
europe
has
shown
i
am
not
alluding
to
the
last
few
generations
of
the
european
peoples
on
both
sides
of
the
ocean
i
mean
the
smaller
europe
of
the
reformation
period
distracted
as
it
was
with
wars
and
religious
disputes
consider
the
world
of
the
eastern
mediterranean
from
sicily
to
western
asia
during
the
period
of
about
1400
years
from
the
death
of
archimedes
in
212
b
c
to
the
irruption
of
the
tartars
there
were
wars
and
revolutions
and
large
changes
of
religion:
but
nothing
much
worse
than
the
wars
of
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
throughout
europe
there
was
a
great
and
wealthy
civilisation
pagan
christian
mahometan
in
that
period
a
great
deal
was
added
to
science
but
on
the
whole
the
progress
was
slow
and
wavering
and
except
in
mathematics
the
men
of
the
renaissance
practically
started
from
the
position
which
archimedes
had
reached
there
had
been
some
progress
in
medicine
and
some
progress
in
astronomy
but
the
total
advance
was
very
little
compared
to
the
marvellous
success
of
the
seventeenth
century
for
example
compare
the
progress
of
scientific
knowledge
from
the
year
1560
just
before
the
births
of
galileo
and
of
kepler
up
to
the
year
1700
when
newton
was
in
the
height
of
his
fame
with
the
progress
in
the
ancient
period
already
mentioned
exactly
ten
times
as
long
nevertheless
greece
was
the
mother
of
europe
and
it
is
to
greece
that
we
must
look
in
order
to
find
the
origin
of
our
modern
ideas
we
all
know
that
on
the
eastern
shores
of
the
mediterranean
there
was
a
very
flourishing
school
of
ionian
philosophers
deeply
interested
in
theories
concerning
nature
their
ideas
have
been
transmitted
to
us
enriched
by
the
genius
of
plato
and
aristotle
but
with
the
exception
of
aristotle
and
it
is
a
large
exception
this
school
of
thought
had
not
attained
to
the
complete
scientific
mentality
in
some
ways
it
was
better
the
greek
genius
was
philosophical
lucid
and
logical
the
men
of
this
group
were
primarily
asking
philosophical
questions
what
is
the
substratum
of
nature?
is
it
fire
or
earth
or
water
or
some
combination
of
any
two
or
of
all
three?
or
is
it
a
mere
flux
not
reducible
to
some
static
material?
mathematics
interested
them
mightily
they
invented
its
generality
analysed
its
premises
and
made
notable
discoveries
of
theorems
by
a
rigid
adherence
to
deductive
reasoning
their
minds
were
infected
with
an
eager
generality
they
demanded
clear
bold
ideas
and
strict
reasoning
from
them
all
this
was
excellent
it
was
genius
it
was
ideal
preparatory
work
but
it
was
not
science
as
we
understand
it
the
patience
of
minute
observation
was
not
nearly
so
prominent
their
genius
was
not
so
apt
for
the
state
of
imaginative
muddled
suspense
which
precedes
successful
inductive
generalisation
they
were
lucid
thinkers
and
bold
reasoners
of
course
there
were
exceptions
and
at
the
very
top:
for
example
aristotle
and
archimedes
also
for
patient
observation
there
were
the
astronomers
there
was
a
mathematical
lucidity
about
the
stars
and
a
fascination
about
the
small
numerable
band
of
run-a-way
planets
every
philosophy
is
tinged
with
the
colouring
of
some
secret
imaginative
background
which
never
emerges
explicitly
into
its
trains
of
reasoning
the
greek
view
of
nature
at
least
that
cosmology
transmitted
from
them
to
later
ages
was
essentially
dramatic
it
is
not
necessarily
wrong
for
this
reason:
but
it
was
overwhelmingly
dramatic
it
thus
conceived
nature
as
articulated
in
the
way
of
a
work
of
dramatic
art
for
the
exemplification
of
general
ideas
converging
to
an
end
nature
was
differentiated
so
as
to
provide
its
proper
end
for
each
thing
there
was
the
centre
of
the
universe
as
the
end
of
motion
for
those
things
which
are
heavy
and
the
celestial
spheres
as
the
end
of
motion
for
those
things
whose
natures
lead
them
upwards
the
celestial
spheres
were
for
things
which
are
impassible
and
ingenerable
the
lower
regions
for
things
impassible
and
generable
nature
was
a
drama
in
which
each
thing
played
its
part
i
do
not
say
that
this
is
a
view
to
which
aristotle
would
have
subscribed
without
severe
reservations
in
fact
without
the
sort
of
reservations
which
we
ourselves
would
make
but
it
was
the
view
which
subsequent
greek
thought
extracted
from
aristotle
and
passed
on
to
the
middle
ages
the
effect
of
such
an
imaginative
setting
for
nature
was
to
damp
down
the
historical
spirit
for
it
was
the
end
which
seemed
illuminating
so
why
bother
about
the
beginning?
the
reformation
and
the
scientific
movement
were
two
aspects
of
the
historical
revolt
which
was
the
dominant
intellectual
movement
of
the
later
renaissance
the
appeal
to
the
origins
of
christianity
and
francis
baconâ€™s
appeal
to
efficient
causes
as
against
final
causes
were
two
sides
of
one
movement
of
thought
also
for
this
reason
galileo
and
his
adversaries
were
at
hopeless
cross
purposes
as
can
be
seen
from
his
dialogues
on
the
two
systems
of
the
world
galileo
keeps
harping
on
how
things
happen
whereas
his
adversaries
had
a
complete
theory
as
to
why
things
happen
unfortunately
the
two
theories
did
not
bring
out
the
same
results
galileo
insists
upon
â€˜irreducible
and
stubborn
facts,â€™
and
simplicius
his
opponent
brings
forward
reasons
completely
satisfactory
at
least
to
himself
it
is
a
great
mistake
to
conceive
this
historical
revolt
as
an
appeal
to
reason
on
the
contrary
it
was
through
and
through
an
anti-intellectualist
movement
it
was
the
return
to
the
contemplation
of
brute
fact
and
it
was
based
on
a
recoil
from
the
inflexible
rationality
of
medieval
thought
in
making
this
statement
i
am
merely
summarising
what
at
the
time
the
adherents
of
the
old
rã©gime
themselves
asserted
for
example
in
the
fourth
book
of
father
paul
sarpiâ€™s
history
of
the
council
of
trent
you
will
find
that
in
the
year
1551
the
papal
legates
who
presided
over
the
council
ordered:
â€˜that
the
divines
ought
to
confirm
their
opinions
with
the
holy
scripture
traditions
of
the
apostles
sacred
and
approved
councils
and
by
the
constitutions
and
authorities
of
the
holy
fathers
that
they
ought
to
use
brevity
and
avoid
superfluous
and
unprofitable
questions
and
perverse
contentions
this
order
did
not
please
the
italian
divines
who
said
it
was
a
novity
and
a
condemning
of
school-divinity
which
in
all
difficulties
useth
reason
and
because
it
was
not
lawful
i.e
by
this
decree
to
treat
as
st
thomas
aquinas
st
bonaventure
and
other
famous
men
did.â€™
it
is
impossible
not
to
feel
sympathy
with
these
italian
divines
maintaining
the
lost
cause
of
unbridled
rationalism
they
were
deserted
on
all
hands
the
protestants
were
in
full
revolt
against
them
the
papacy
failed
to
support
them
and
the
bishops
of
the
council
could
not
even
understand
them
for
a
few
sentences
below
the
foregoing
quotation
we
read:
â€˜though
many
complained
here-of
i.e
of
the
decree
yet
it
prevailed
but
little
because
generally
the
fathers
i.e
the
bishops
desired
to
hear
men
speak
with
intelligible
terms
not
abstrusely
as
in
the
matter
of
justification
and
others
already
handled.â€™
poor
belated
medievalists
when
they
used
reason
they
were
not
even
intelligible
to
the
ruling
powers
of
their
epoch
it
will
take
centuries
before
stubborn
facts
are
reducible
by
reason
and
meanwhile
the
pendulum
swings
slowly
and
heavily
to
the
extreme
of
the
historical
method
forty-three
years
after
the
italian
divines
had
written
this
memorial
richard
hooker
in
his
famous
laws
of
ecclesiastical
polity
makes
exactly
the
same
complaint
of
his
puritan
adversaries.[1
hookerâ€™s
balanced
thoughtâ€”from
which
the
appellation
â€˜the
judicious
hookerâ€™
is
derivedâ€”
and
his
diffuse
style
which
is
the
vehicle
of
such
thought
make
his
writings
singularly
unfit
for
the
process
of
summarising
by
a
short
pointed
quotation
but
in
the
section
referred
to
he
reproaches
his
opponents
with
their
disparagement
of
reason
and
in
support
of
his
own
position
definitely
refers
to
â€˜the
greatest
amongst
the
school-divines,â€™
by
which
designation
i
presume
that
he
refers
to
st

hookerâ€™s
ecclesiastical
polity
was
published
just
before
sarpiâ€™s
council
of
trent
accordingly
there
was
complete
independence
between
the
two
works
but
both
the
italian
divines
of
1551
and
hooker
at
the
end
of
that
century
testify
to
the
anti-rationalist
trend
of
thought
at
that
epoch
and
in
this
respect
contrast
their
own
age
with
the
epoch
of
scholasticism
this
reaction
was
undoubtedly
a
very
necessary
corrective
to
the
unguarded
rationalism
of
the
middle
ages
but
reactions
run
to
extremes
accordingly
although
one
outcome
of
this
reaction
was
the
birth
of
modern
science
yet
we
must
remember
that
science
thereby
inherited
the
bias
of
thought
to
which
it
owes
its
origin
the
effect
of
greek
dramatic
literature
was
many-sided
so
far
as
concerns
the
various
ways
in
which
it
indirectly
affected
medieval
thought
the
pilgrim
fathers
of
the
scientific
imagination
as
it
exists
today
are
the
great
tragedians
of
ancient
athens
aeschylus
sophocles
euripides
their
vision
of
fate
remorseless
and
indifferent
urging
a
tragic
incident
to
its
inevitable
issue
is
the
vision
possessed
by
science
fate
in
greek
tragedy
becomes
the
order
of
nature
in
modern
thought
the
absorbing
interest
in
the
particular
heroic
incidents
as
an
example
and
a
verification
of
the
workings
of
fate
reappears
in
our
epoch
as
concentration
of
interest
on
the
crucial
experiments
it
was
my
good
fortune
to
be
present
at
the
meeting
of
the
royal
society
in
london
when
the
astronomer
royal
for
england
announced
that
the
photographic
plates
of
the
famous
eclipse
as
measured
by
his
colleagues
in
greenwich
observatory
had
verified
the
prediction
of
einstein
that
rays
of
light
are
bent
as
they
pass
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
sun
the
whole
atmosphere
of
tense
interest
was
exactly
that
of
the
greek
drama:
we
were
the
chorus
commenting
on
the
decree
of
destiny
as
disclosed
in
the
development
of
a
supreme
incident
there
was
dramatic
quality
in
the
very
staging:â€”the
traditional
ceremonial
and
in
the
background
the
picture
of
newton
to
remind
us
that
the
greatest
of
scientific
generalisations
was
now
after
more
than
two
centuries
to
receive
its
first
modification
nor
was
the
personal
interest
wanting:
a
great
adventure
in
thought
had
at
length
come
safe
to
shore
let
me
here
remind
you
that
the
essence
of
dramatic
tragedy
is
not
unhappiness
it
resides
in
the
solemnity
of
the
remorseless
working
of
things
this
inevitableness
of
destiny
can
only
be
illustrated
in
terms
of
human
life
by
incidents
which
in
fact
involve
unhappiness
for
it
is
only
by
them
that
the
futility
of
escape
can
be
made
evident
in
the
drama
this
remorseless
inevitableness
is
what
pervades
scientific
thought
the
laws
of
physics
are
the
decrees
of
fate
the
conception
of
the
moral
order
in
the
greek
plays
was
certainly
not
a
discovery
of
the
dramatists
it
must
have
passed
into
the
literary
tradition
from
the
general
serious
opinion
of
the
times
but
in
finding
this
magnificent
expression
it
thereby
deepened
the
stream
of
thought
from
which
it
arose
the
spectacle
of
a
moral
order
was
impressed
upon
the
imagination
of
classical
civilisation
the
time
came
when
that
great
society
decayed
and
europe
passed
into
the
middle
ages
the
direct
influence
of
greek
literature
vanished
but
the
concept
of
the
moral
order
and
of
the
order
of
nature
had
enshrined
itself
in
the
stoic
philosophy
for
example
lecky
in
his
history
of
european
morals
tells
us
â€˜seneca
maintains
that
the
divinity
has
determined
all
things
by
an
inexorable
law
of
destiny
which
he
has
decreed
but
which
he
himself
obeys.â€™
but
the
most
effective
way
in
which
the
stoics
influenced
the
mentality
of
the
middle
ages
was
by
the
diffused
sense
of
order
which
arose
from
roman
law
again
to
quote
lecky
â€˜the
roman
legislation
was
in
a
two-fold
manner
the
child
of
philosophy
it
was
in
the
first
place
formed
upon
the
philosophical
model
for
instead
of
being
a
mere
empirical
system
adjusted
to
the
existing
requirements
of
society
it
laid
down
abstract
principles
of
right
to
which
it
endeavoured
to
conform
and
in
the
next
place
these
principles
were
borrowed
directly
from
stoicism.â€™
in
spite
of
the
actual
anarchy
throughout
large
regions
in
europe
after
the
collapse
of
the
empire
the
sense
of
legal
order
always
haunted
the
racial
memories
of
the
imperial
populations
also
the
western
church
was
always
there
as
a
living
embodiment
of
the
traditions
of
imperial
rule
it
is
important
to
notice
that
this
legal
impress
upon
medieval
civilisation
was
not
in
the
form
of
a
few
wise
precepts
which
should
permeate
conduct
it
was
the
conception
of
a
definite
articulated
system
which
defines
the
legality
of
the
detailed
structure
of
social
organism
and
of
the
detailed
way
in
which
it
should
function
there
was
nothing
vague
it
was
not
a
question
of
admirable
maxims
but
of
definite
procedure
to
put
things
right
and
to
keep
them
there
the
middle
ages
formed
one
long
training
of
the
intellect
of
western
europe
in
the
sense
of
order
there
may
have
been
some
deficiency
in
respect
to
practice
but
the
idea
never
for
a
moment
lost
its
grip
it
was
preã«minently
an
epoch
of
orderly
thought
rationalist
through
and
through
the
very
anarchy
quickened
the
sense
for
coherent
system
just
as
the
modern
anarchy
of
europe
has
stimulated
the
intellectual
vision
of
a
league
of
nations
but
for
science
something
more
is
wanted
than
a
general
sense
of
the
order
in
things
it
needs
but
a
sentence
to
point
out
how
the
habit
of
definite
exact
thought
was
implanted
in
the
european
mind
by
the
long
dominance
of
scholastic
logic
and
scholastic
divinity
the
habit
remained
after
the
philosophy
had
been
repudiated
the
priceless
habit
of
looking
for
an
exact
point
and
of
sticking
to
it
when
found
galileo
owes
more
to
aristotle
than
appears
on
the
surface
of
his
dialogues_:
he
owes
to
him
his
clear
head
and
his
analytic
mind
i
do
not
think
however
that
i
have
even
yet
brought
out
the
greatest
contribution
of
medievalism
to
the
formation
of
the
scientific
movement
i
mean
the
inexpugnable
belief
that
every
detailed
occurrence
can
be
correlated
with
its
antecedents
in
a
perfectly
definite
manner
exemplifying
general
principles
without
this
belief
the
incredible
labours
of
scientists
would
be
without
hope
it
is
this
instinctive
conviction
vividly
poised
before
the
imagination
which
is
the
motive
power
of
research:â€”that
there
is
a
secret
a
secret
which
can
be
unveiled
how
has
this
conviction
been
so
vividly
implanted
on
the
european
mind?
when
we
compare
this
tone
of
thought
in
europe
with
the
attitude
of
other
civilisations
when
left
to
themselves
there
seems
but
one
source
for
its
origin
it
must
come
from
the
medieval
insistence
on
the
rationality
of
god
conceived
as
with
the
personal
energy
of
jehovah
and
with
the
rationality
of
a
greek
philosopher
every
detail
was
supervised
and
ordered:
the
search
into
nature
could
only
result
in
the
vindication
of
the
faith
in
rationality
remember
that
i
am
not
talking
of
the
explicit
beliefs
of
a
few
individuals
what
i
mean
is
the
impress
on
the
european
mind
arising
from
the
unquestioned
faith
of
centuries
by
this
i
mean
the
instinctive
tone
of
thought
and
not
a
mere
creed
of
words
in
asia
the
conceptions
of
god
were
of
a
being
who
was
either
too
arbitrary
or
too
impersonal
for
such
ideas
to
have
much
effect
on
instinctive
habits
of
mind
any
definite
occurrence
might
be
due
to
the
fiat
of
an
irrational
despot
or
might
issue
from
some
impersonal
inscrutable
origin
of
things
there
was
not
the
same
confidence
as
in
the
intelligible
rationality
of
a
personal
being
i
am
not
arguing
that
the
european
trust
in
the
scrutability
of
nature
was
logically
justified
even
by
its
own
theology
my
only
point
is
to
understand
how
it
arose
my
explanation
is
that
the
faith
in
the
possibility
of
science
generated
antecedently
to
the
development
of
modern
scientific
theory
is
an
unconscious
derivative
from
medieval
theology
but
science
is
not
merely
the
outcome
of
instinctive
faith
it
also
requires
an
active
interest
in
the
simple
occurrences
of
life
for
their
own
sake
this
qualification
â€˜for
their
own
sakeâ€™
is
important
the
first
phase
of
the
middle
ages
was
an
age
of
symbolism
it
was
an
age
of
vast
ideas
and
of
primitive
technique
there
was
little
to
be
done
with
nature
except
to
coin
a
hard
living
from
it
but
there
were
realms
of
thought
to
be
explored
realms
of
philosophy
and
realms
of
theology
primitive
art
could
symbolise
those
ideas
which
filled
all
thoughtful
minds
the
first
phase
of
medieval
art
has
a
haunting
charm
beyond
compare:
its
own
intrinsic
quality
is
enhanced
by
the
fact
that
its
message
which
stretched
beyond
artâ€™s
own
self-justification
of
aesthetic
achievement
was
the
symbolism
of
things
lying
behind
nature
itself
in
this
symbolic
phase
medieval
art
energised
in
nature
as
its
medium
but
pointed
to
another
world
in
order
to
understand
the
contrast
between
these
early
middle
ages
and
the
atmosphere
required
by
the
scientific
mentality
we
should
compare
the
sixth
century
in
italy
with
the
sixteenth
century
in
both
centuries
the
italian
genius
was
laying
the
foundations
of
a
new
epoch
the
history
of
the
three
centuries
preceding
the
earlier
period
despite
the
promise
for
the
future
introduced
by
the
rise
of
christianity
is
overwhelmingly
infected
by
the
sense
of
the
decline
of
civilisation
in
each
generation
something
has
been
lost
as
we
read
the
records
we
are
haunted
by
the
shadow
of
the
coming
barbarism
there
are
great
men
with
fine
achievements
in
action
or
in
thought
but
their
total
effect
is
merely
for
some
short
time
to
arrest
the
general
decline
in
the
sixth
century
we
are
so
far
as
italy
is
concerned
at
the
lowest
point
of
the
curve
but
in
that
century
every
action
is
laying
the
foundation
for
the
tremendous
rise
of
the
new
european
civilisation
in
the
background
the
byzantine
empire
under
justinian
in
three
ways
determined
the
character
of
the
early
middle
ages
in
western
europe
in
the
first
place
its
armies
under
belisarius
and
narses
cleared
italy
from
the
gothic
domination
in
this
way
the
stage
was
freed
for
the
exercise
of
the
old
italian
genius
for
creating
organisations
which
shall
be
protective
of
ideals
of
cultural
activity
it
is
impossible
not
to
sympathise
with
the
goths:
yet
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
that
a
thousand
years
of
the
papacy
were
infinitely
more
valuable
for
europe
than
any
effects
derivable
from
a
well-established
gothic
kingdom
of
italy
in
the
second
place
the
codification
of
the
roman
law
established
the
ideal
of
legality
which
dominated
the
sociological
thought
of
europe
in
the
succeeding
centuries
law
is
both
an
engine
for
government
and
a
condition
restraining
government
the
canon
law
of
the
church
and
the
civil
law
of
the
state
owe
to
justinianâ€™s
lawyers
their
influence
on
the
development
of
europe
they
established
in
the
western
mind
the
ideal
that
an
authority
should
be
at
once
lawful
and
law-enforcing
and
should
in
itself
exhibit
a
rationally
adjusted
system
of
organisation
the
sixth
century
in
italy
gave
the
initial
exhibition
of
the
way
in
which
the
impress
of
these
ideas
was
fostered
by
contact
with
the
byzantine
empire
thirdly
in
the
non-political
spheres
of
art
and
learning
constantinople
exhibited
a
standard
of
realised
achievement
which
partly
by
the
impulse
to
direct
imitation
and
partly
by
the
indirect
inspiration
arising
from
the
mere
knowledge
that
such
things
existed
acted
as
a
perpetual
spur
to
western
culture
the
wisdom
of
the
byzantines
as
it
stood
in
the
imagination
of
the
first
phase
of
medieval
mentality
and
the
wisdom
of
the
egyptians
as
it
stood
in
the
imagination
of
the
early
greeks
played
analogous
rã´les
probably
the
actual
knowledge
of
these
respective
wisdoms
was
in
either
case
about
as
much
as
was
good
for
the
recipients
they
knew
enough
to
know
the
sort
of
standards
which
are
attainable
and
not
enough
to
be
fettered
by
static
and
traditional
ways
of
thought
accordingly
in
both
cases
men
went
ahead
on
their
own
and
did
better
no
account
of
the
rise
of
the
european
scientific
mentality
can
omit
some
notice
of
this
influence
of
the
byzantine
civilisation
in
the
background
in
the
sixth
century
there
is
a
crisis
in
the
history
of
the
relations
between
the
byzantines
and
the
west
and
this
crisis
is
to
be
contrasted
with
the
influence
of
greek
literature
on
european
thought
in
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
the
two
outstanding
men
who
in
the
italy
of
the
sixth
century
laid
the
foundations
of
the
future
were
st
benedict
and
gregory
the
great
by
reference
to
them
we
can
at
once
see
how
absolutely
in
ruins
was
the
approach
to
the
scientific
mentality
which
had
been
attained
by
the
greeks
we
are
at
the
zero
point
of
scientific
temperature
but
the
life-work
of
gregory
and
of
benedict
contributed
elements
to
the
reconstruction
of
europe
which
secured
that
this
reconstruction
when
it
arrived
should
include
a
more
effective
scientific
mentality
than
that
of
the
ancient
world
the
greeks
were
over-theoretical
for
them
science
was
an
offshoot
of
philosophy
gregory
and
benedict
were
practical
men
with
an
eye
for
the
importance
of
ordinary
things
and
they
combined
this
practical
temperament
with
their
religious
and
cultural
activities
in
particular
we
owe
it
to
st
benedict
that
the
monasteries
were
the
homes
of
practical
agriculturalists
as
well
as
of
saints
and
of
artists
and
of
men
of
learning
the
alliance
of
science
with
technology
by
which
learning
is
kept
in
contact
with
irreducible
and
stubborn
facts
owes
much
to
the
practical
bent
of
the
early
benedictines
modern
science
derives
from
rome
as
well
as
from
greece
and
this
roman
strain
explains
its
gain
in
an
energy
of
thought
kept
closely
in
contact
with
the
world
of
facts
but
the
influence
of
this
contact
between
the
monasteries
and
the
facts
of
nature
showed
itself
first
in
art
the
rise
of
naturalism
in
the
later
middle
ages
was
the
entry
into
the
european
mind
of
the
final
ingredient
necessary
for
the
rise
of
science
it
was
the
rise
of
interest
in
natural
objects
and
in
natural
occurrences
for
their
own
sakes
the
natural
foliage
of
a
district
was
sculptured
in
out-of-the-way
spots
of
the
later
buildings
merely
as
exhibiting
delight
in
those
familiar
objects
the
whole
atmosphere
of
every
art
exhibited
a
direct
joy
in
the
apprehension
of
the
things
which
lie
around
us
the
craftsmen
who
executed
the
late
medieval
decorative
sculpture
giotto
chaucer
wordsworth
walt
whitman
and
at
the
present
day
the
new
england
poet
robert
frost
are
all
akin
to
each
other
in
this
respect
the
simple
immediate
facts
are
the
topics
of
interest
and
these
reappear
in
the
thought
of
science
as
the
â€˜irreducible
stubborn
facts.â€™
the
mind
of
europe
was
now
prepared
for
its
new
venture
of
thought
it
is
unnecessary
to
tell
in
detail
the
various
incidents
which
marked
the
rise
of
science:
the
growth
of
wealth
and
leisure
the
expansion
of
universities
the
invention
of
printing
the
taking
of
constantinople
copernicus
vasco
da
gama
columbus
the
telescope
the
soil
the
climate
the
seeds
were
there
and
the
forest
grew
science
has
never
shaken
off
the
impress
of
its
origin
in
the
historical
revolt
of
the
later
renaissance
it
has
remained
predominantly
an
anti-rationalistic
movement
based
upon
a
naã¯ve
faith
what
reasoning
it
has
wanted
has
been
borrowed
from
mathematics
which
is
a
surviving
relic
of
greek
rationalism
following
the
deductive
method
science
repudiates
philosophy
in
other
words
it
has
never
cared
to
justify
its
faith
or
to
explain
its
meanings
and
has
remained
blandly
indifferent
to
its
refutation
by
hume
of
course
the
historical
revolt
was
fully
justified
it
was
wanted
it
was
more
than
wanted:
it
was
an
absolute
necessity
for
healthy
progress
the
world
required
centuries
of
contemplation
of
irreducible
and
stubborn
facts
it
is
difficult
for
men
to
do
more
than
one
thing
at
a
time
and
that
was
the
sort
of
thing
they
had
to
do
after
the
rationalistic
orgy
of
the
middle
ages
it
was
a
very
sensible
reaction
but
it
was
not
a
protest
on
behalf
of
reason
there
is
however
a
nemesis
which
waits
upon
those
who
deliberately
avoid
avenues
of
knowledge
oliver
cromwellâ€™s
cry
echoes
down
the
ages
â€˜my
brethren

you
bethink

that
you
may

mistaken.â€™
the
progress
of
science
has
now
reached
a
turning
point
the
stable
foundations
of
physics
have
broken
up:
also
for
the
first
time
physiology
is
asserting
itself
as
an
effective
body
of
knowledge
as
distinct
from
a
scrap-heap
the
old
foundations
of
scientific
thought
are
becoming
unintelligible
time
space
matter
material
ether
electricity
mechanism
organism
configuration

all
require
reinterpretation
what
is
the
sense
of
talking
about
a
mechanical
explanation
when
you
do
not
know
what
you
mean
by
mechanics?
the
truth
is
that
science
started
its
modern
career
by
taking
over
ideas
derived
from
the
weakest
side
of
the
philosophies
of
aristotleâ€™s
successors
in
some
respects
it
was
a
happy
choice
it
enabled
the
knowledge
of
the
seventeenth
century
to
be
formularised
so
far
as
physics
and
chemistry
were
concerned
with
a
completeness
which
has
lasted
to
the
present
time
but
the
progress
of
biology
and
psychology
has
probably
been
checked
by
the
uncritical
assumption
of
half-truths
if
science
is
not
to
degenerate
into
a
medley
of
ad
hoc
hypotheses
it
must
become
philosophical
and
must
enter
upon
a
thorough
criticism
of
its
own
foundations
in
the
succeeding
lectures
of
this
course
i
shall
trace
the
successes
and
the
failures
of
the
particular
conceptions
of
cosmology
with
which
the
european
intellect
has
clothed
itself
in
the
last
three
centuries

climates
of
opinion
persist
for
periods
of
about
two
to
three
generations
that
is
to
say
for
periods
of
sixty
to
a
hundred
years
there
are
also
shorter
waves
of
thought
which
play
on
the
surface
of
the
tidal
movement
we
shall
find
therefore
transformations
in
the
european
outlook
slowly
modifying
the
successive
centuries
there
persists
however
throughout
the
whole
period
the
fixed
scientific
cosmology
which
presupposes
the
ultimate
fact
of
an
irreducible
brute
matter
or
material
spread
throughout
space
in
a
flux
of
configurations
in
itself
such
a
material
is
senseless
valueless
purposeless
it
just
does
what
it
does
do
following
a
fixed
routine
imposed
by
external
relations
which
do
not
spring
from
the
nature
of
its
being
it
is
this
assumption
that
i
call
â€˜scientific
materialism.â€™
also
it
is
an
assumption
which
i
shall
challenge
as
being
entirely
unsuited
to
the
scientific
situation
at
which
we
have
now
arrived
it
is
not
wrong
if
properly
construed
if
we
confine
ourselves
to
certain
types
of
facts
abstracted
from
the
complete
circumstances
in
which
they
occur
the
materialistic
assumption
expresses
these
facts
to
perfection
but
when
we
pass
beyond
the
abstraction
either
by
more
subtle
employment
of
our
senses
or
by
the
request
for
meanings
and
for
coherence
of
thoughts
the
scheme
breaks
down
at
once
the
narrow
efficiency
of
the
scheme
was
the
very
cause
of
its
supreme
methodological
success
for
it
directed
attention
to
just
those
groups
of
facts
which
in
the
state
of
knowledge
then
existing
required
investigation
the
success
of
the
scheme
has
adversely
affected
the
various
currents
of
european
thought
the
historical
revolt
was
anti-rationalistic
because
the
rationalism
of
the
scholastics
required
a
sharp
correction
by
contact
with
brute
fact
but
the
revival
of
philosophy
in
the
hands
of
descartes
and
his
successors
was
entirely
coloured
in
its
development
by
the
acceptance
of
the
scientific
cosmology
at
its
face
value
the
success
of
their
ultimate
ideas
confirmed
scientists
in
their
refusal
to
modify
them
as
the
result
of
an
enquiry
into
their
rationality
every
philosophy
was
bound
in
some
way
or
other
to
swallow
them
whole
also
the
example
of
science
affected
other
regions
of
thought
the
historical
revolt
has
thus
been
exaggerated
into
the
exclusion
of
philosophy
from
its
proper
rã´le
of
harmonising
the
various
abstractions
of
methodological
thought
thought
is
abstract
and
the
intolerant
use
of
abstractions
is
the
major
vice
of
the
intellect
this
vice
is
not
wholly
corrected
by
the
recurrence
to
concrete
experience
for
after
all
you
need
only
attend
to
those
aspects
of
your
concrete
experience
which
lie
within
some
limited
scheme
there
are
two
methods
for
the
purification
of
ideas
one
of
them
is
dispassionate
observation
by
means
of
the
bodily
senses
but
observation
is
selection
accordingly
it
is
difficult
to
transcend
a
scheme
of
abstraction
whose
success
is
sufficiently
wide
the
other
method
is
by
comparing
the
various
schemes
of
abstraction
which
are
well
founded
in
our
various
types
of
experience
this
comparison
takes
the
form
of
satisfying
the
demands
of
the
italian
scholastic
divines
whom
paul
sarpi
mentioned
they
asked
that
reason
should
be
used
faith
in
reason
is
the
trust
that
the
ultimate
natures
of
things
lie
together
in
a
harmony
which
excludes
mere
arbitrariness
it
is
the
faith
that
at
the
base
of
things
we
shall
not
find
mere
arbitrary
mystery
the
faith
in
the
order
of
nature
which
has
made
possible
the
growth
of
science
is
a
particular
example
of
a
deeper
faith
this
faith
cannot
be
justified
by
any
inductive
generalisation
it
springs
from
direct
inspection
of
the
nature
of
things
as
disclosed
in
our
own
immediate
present
experience
there
is
no
parting
from
your
own
shadow
to
experience
this
faith
is
to
know
that
in
being
ourselves
we
are
more
than
ourselves:
to
know
that
our
experience
dim
and
fragmentary
as
it
is
yet
sounds
the
utmost
depths
of
reality:
to
know
that
detached
details
merely
in
order
to
be
themselves
demand
that
they
should
find
themselves
in
a
system
of
things:
to
know
that
this
system
includes
the
harmony
of
logical
rationality
and
the
harmony
of
aesthetic
achievement:
to
know
that
while
the
harmony
of
logic
lies
upon
the
universe
as
an
iron
necessity
the
aesthetic
harmony
stands
before
it
as
a
living
ideal

the
general
flux
in
its
broken
progress
towards
finer
subtler
issues

mathematics
as
an
element
in
the
history
of
thought
the
science
of
pure
mathematics
in
its
modern
developments
may
claim
to
be
the
most
original
creation
of
the
human
spirit
another
claimant
for
this
position
is
music
but
we
will
put
aside
all
rivals
and
consider
the
ground
on
which
such
a
claim
can
be
made
for
mathematics
the
originality
of
mathematics
consists
in
the
fact
that
in
mathematical
science
connections
between
things
are
exhibited
which
apart
from
the
agency
of
human
reason
are
extremely
unobvious
thus
the
ideas
now
in
the
minds
of
contemporary
mathematicians
lie
very
remote
from
any
notions
which
can
be
immediately
derived
by
perception
through
the
senses
unless
indeed
it
be
perception
stimulated
and
guided
by
antecedent
mathematical
knowledge
this
is
the
thesis
which
i
proceed
to
exemplify
suppose
we
project
our
imaginations
backwards
through
many
thousands
of
years
and
endeavour
to
realise
the
simple-mindedness
of
even
the
greatest
intellects
in
those
early
societies
abstract
ideas
which
to
us
are
immediately
obvious
must
have
been
for
them
matters
only
of
the
most
dim
apprehension
for
example
take
the
question
of
number
we
think
of
the
number
â€˜fiveâ€™
as
applying
to
appropriate
groups
of
any
entities
whatsoeverâ€”to
five
fishes
five
children
five
apples
five
days
thus
in
considering
the
relations
of
the
number
â€˜fiveâ€™
to
the
number
â€˜three,â€™
we
are
thinking
of
two
groups
of
things
one
with
five
members
and
the
other
with
three
members
but
we
are
entirely
abstracting
from
any
consideration
of
any
particular
entities
or
even
of
any
particular
sorts
of
entities
which
go
to
make
up
the
membership
of
either
of
the
two
groups
we
are
merely
thinking
of
those
relationships
between
those
two
groups
which
are
entirely
independent
of
the
individual
essences
of
any
of
the
members
of
either
group
this
is
a
very
remarkable
feat
of
abstraction
and
it
must
have
taken
ages
for
the
human
race
to
rise
to
it
during
a
long
period
groups
of
fishes
will
have
been
compared
to
each
other
in
respect
to
their
multiplicity
and
groups
of
days
to
each
other
but
the
first
man
who
noticed
the
analogy
between
a
group
of
seven
fishes
and
a
group
of
seven
days
made
a
notable
advance
in
the
history
of
thought
he
was
the
first
man
who
entertained
a
concept
belonging
to
the
science
of
pure
mathematics
at
that
moment
it
must
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
divine
the
complexity
and
subtlety
of
these
abstract
mathematical
ideas
which
were
waiting
for
discovery
nor
could
he
have
guessed
that
these
notions
would
exert
a
widespread
fascination
in
each
succeeding
generation
there
is
an
erroneous
literary
tradition
which
represents
the
love
of
mathematics
as
a
monomania
confined
to
a
few
eccentrics
in
each
generation
but
be
this
as
it
may
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
anticipate
the
pleasure
derivable
from
a
type
of
abstract
thinking
which
had
no
counterpart
in
the
then-existing
society
thirdly
the
tremendous
future
effect
of
mathematical
knowledge
on
the
lives
of
men
on
their
daily
avocations
on
their
habitual
thoughts
on
the
organization
of
society
must
have
been
even
more
completely
shrouded
from
the
foresight
of
those
early
thinkers
even
now
there
is
a
very
wavering
grasp
of
the
true
position
of
mathematics
as
an
element
in
the
history
of
thought
i
will
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
to
construct
a
history
of
thought
without
profound
study
of
the
mathematical
ideas
of
successive
epochs
is
like
omitting
hamlet
from
the
play
which
is
named
after
him
that
would
be
claiming
too
much
but
it
is
certainly
analogous
to
cutting
out
the
part
of
ophelia
this
simile
is
singularly
exact
for
ophelia
is
quite
essential
to
the
play
she
is
very
charming,â€”and
a
little
mad
let
us
grant
that
the
pursuit
of
mathematics
is
a
divine
madness
of
the
human
spirit
a
refuge
from
the
goading
urgency
of
contingent
happenings
when
we
think
of
mathematics
we
have
in
our
mind
a
science
devoted
to
the
exploration
of
number
quantity
geometry
and
in
modern
times
also
including
investigation
into
yet
more
abstract
concepts
of
order
and
into
analogous
types
of
purely
logical
relations
the
point
of
mathematics
is
that
in
it
we
have
always
got
rid
of
the
particular
instance
and
even
of
any
particular
sorts
of
entities
so
that
for
example
no
mathematical
truths
apply
merely
to
fish
or
merely
to
stones
or
merely
to
colours
so
long
as
you
are
dealing
with
pure
mathematics
you
are
in
the
realm
of
complete
and
absolute
abstraction
all
you
assert
is
that
reason
insists
on
the
admission
that
if
any
entities
whatever
have
any
relations
which
satisfy
such-and-such
purely
abstract
conditions
then
they
must
have
other
relations
which
satisfy
other
purely
abstract
conditions
mathematics
is
thought
moving
in
the
sphere
of
complete
abstraction
from
any
particular
instance
of
what
it
is
talking
about
so
far
is
this
view
of
mathematics
from
being
obvious
that
we
can
easily
assure
ourselves
that
it
is
not
even
now
generally
understood
for
example
it
is
habitually
thought
that
the
certainty
of
mathematics
is
a
reason
for
the
certainty
of
our
geometrical
knowledge
of
the
space
of
the
physical
universe
this
is
a
delusion
which
has
vitiated
much
philosophy
in
the
past
and
some
philosophy
in
the
present
this
question
of
geometry
is
a
test
case
of
some
urgency
there
are
certain
alternative
sets
of
purely
abstract
conditions
possible
for
the
relationships
of
groups
of
unspecified
entities
which
i
will
call
geometrical
conditions
i
give
them
this
name
because
of
their
general
analogy
to
those
conditions
which
we
believe
to
hold
respecting
the
particular
geometrical
relations
of
things
observed
by
us
in
our
direct
perception
of
nature
so
far
as
our
observations
are
concerned
we
are
not
quite
accurate
enough
to
be
certain
of
the
exact
conditions
regulating
the
things
we
come
across
in
nature
but
we
can
by
a
slight
stretch
of
hypothesis
identify
these
observed
conditions
with
some
one
set
of
the
purely
abstract
geometrical
conditions
in
doing
so
we
make
a
particular
determination
of
the
group
of
unspecified
entities
which
are
the
relata
in
the
abstract
science
in
the
pure
mathematics
of
geometrical
relationships
we
say
that
if
any
group
of
entities
enjoy
any
relationships
among
its
members
satisfying
this
set
of
abstract
geometrical
conditions
then
such-and-such
additional
abstract
conditions
must
also
hold
for
such
relationships
but
when
we
come
to
physical
space
we
say
that
some
definitely
observed
group
of
physical
entities
enjoys
some
definitely
observed
relationships
among
its
members
which
do
satisfy
this
above-mentioned
set
of
abstract
geometrical
conditions
we
thence
conclude
that
the
additional
relationships
which
we
concluded
to
hold
in
any
such
case
must
therefore
hold
in
this
particular
case
the
certainty
of
mathematics
depends
upon
its
complete
abstract
generality
but
we
can
have
no
ã
priori
certainty
that
we
are
right
in
believing
that
the
observed
entities
in
the
concrete
universe
form
a
particular
instance
of
what
falls
under
our
general
reasoning
to
take
another
example
from
arithmetic
it
is
a
general
abstract
truth
of
pure
mathematics
that
any
group
of
forty
entities
can
be
subdivided
into
two
groups
of
twenty
entities
we
are
therefore
justified
in
concluding
that
a
particular
group
of
apples
which
we
believe
to
contain
forty
members
can
be
subdivided
into
two
groups
of
apples
of
which
each
contains
twenty
members
but
there
always
remains
the
possibility
that
we
have
miscounted
the
big
group
so
that
when
we
come
in
practice
to
subdivide
it
we
shall
find
that
one
of
the
two
heaps
has
an
apple
too
few
or
an
apple
too
many
accordingly
in
criticising
an
argument
based
upon
the
application
of
mathematics
to
particular
matters
of
fact
there
are
always
three
processes
to
be
kept
perfectly
distinct
in
our
minds
we
must
first
scan
the
purely
mathematical
reasoning
to
make
sure
that
there
are
no
mere
slips
in
itâ€”no
casual
illogicalities
due
to
mental
failure
any
mathematician
knows
from
bitter
experience
that
in
first
elaborating
a
train
of
reasoning
it
is
very
easy
to
commit
a
slight
error
which
yet
makes
all
the
difference
but
when
a
piece
of
mathematics
has
been
revised
and
has
been
before
the
expert
world
for
some
time
the
chance
of
a
casual
error
is
almost
negligible
the
next
process
is
to
make
quite
certain
of
all
the
abstract
conditions
which
have
been
presupposed
to
hold
this
is
the
determination
of
the
abstract
premises
from
which
the
mathematical
reasoning
proceeds
this
is
a
matter
of
considerable
difficulty
in
the
past
quite
remarkable
oversights
have
been
made
and
have
been
accepted
by
generations
of
the
greatest
mathematicians
the
chief
danger
is
that
of
oversight
namely
tacitly
to
introduce
some
condition
which
it
is
natural
for
us
to
presuppose
but
which
in
fact
need
not
always
be
holding
there
is
another
opposite
oversight
in
this
connection
which
does
not
lead
to
error
but
only
to
lack
of
simplification
it
is
very
easy
to
think
that
more
postulated
conditions
are
required
than
is
in
fact
the
case
in
other
words
we
may
think
that
some
abstract
postulate
is
necessary
which
is
in
fact
capable
of
being
proved
from
the
other
postulates
that
we
have
already
on
hand
the
only
effects
of
this
excess
of
abstract
postulates
are
to
diminish
our
aesthetic
pleasure
in
the
mathematical
reasoning
and
to
give
us
more
trouble
when
we
come
to
the
third
process
of
criticism
this
third
process
of
criticism
is
that
of
verifying
that
our
abstract
postulates
hold
for
the
particular
case
in
question
it
is
in
respect
to
this
process
of
verification
for
the
particular
case
that
all
the
trouble
arises
in
some
simple
instances
such
as
the
counting
of
forty
apples
we
can
with
a
little
care
arrive
at
practical
certainty
but
in
general
with
more
complex
instances
complete
certainty
is
unattainable
volumes
libraries
of
volumes
have
been
written
on
the
subject
it
is
the
battle
ground
of
rival
philosophers
there
are
two
distinct
questions
involved
there
are
particular
definite
things
observed
and
we
have
to
make
sure
that
the
relations
between
these
things
really
do
obey
certain
definite
exact
abstract
conditions
there
is
great
room
for
error
here
the
exact
observational
methods
of
science
are
all
contrivances
for
limiting
these
erroneous
conclusions
as
to
direct
matters
of
fact
but
another
question
arises
the
things
directly
observed
are
almost
always
only
samples
we
want
to
conclude
that
the
abstract
conditions
which
hold
for
the
samples
also
hold
for
all
other
entities
which
for
some
reason
or
other
appear
to
us
to
be
of
the
same
sort
this
process
of
reasoning
from
the
sample
to
the
whole
species
is
induction
the
theory
of
induction
is
the
despair
of
philosophyâ€”and
yet
all
our
activities
are
based
upon
it
anyhow
in
criticising
a
mathematical
conclusion
as
to
a
particular
matter
of
fact
the
real
difficulties
consist
in
finding
out
the
abstract
assumptions
involved
and
in
estimating
the
evidence
for
their
applicability
to
the
particular
case
in
hand
it
often
happens
therefore
that
in
criticising
a
learned
book
of
applied
mathematics
or
a
memoir
oneâ€™s
whole
trouble
is
with
the
first
chapter
or
even
with
the
first
page
for
it
is
there
at
the
very
outset
where
the
author
will
probably
be
found
to
slip
in
his
assumptions
farther
the
trouble
is
not
with
what
the
author
does
say
but
with
what
he
does
not
say
also
it
is
not
with
what
he
knows
he
has
assumed
but
with
what
he
has
unconsciously
assumed
we
do
not
doubt
the
authorâ€™s
honesty
it
is
his
perspicacity
which
we
are
criticising
each
generation
criticises
the
unconscious
assumptions
made
by
its
parents
it
may
assent
to
them
but
it
brings
them
out
in
the
open
the
history
of
the
development
of
language
illustrates
this
point
it
is
a
history
of
the
progressive
analysis
of
ideas
latin
and
greek
were
inflected
languages
this
means
that
they
express
an
unanalyzed
complex
of
ideas
by
the
mere
modification
of
a
word
whereas
in
english
for
example
we
use
prepositions
and
auxiliary
verbs
to
drag
into
the
open
the
whole
bundle
of
ideas
involved
for
certain
forms
of
literary
art,â€”though
not
alwaysâ€”the
compact
absorption
of
auxiliary
ideas
into
the
main
word
may
be
an
advantage
but
in
a
language
such
as
english
there
is
the
overwhelming
gain
in
explicitness
this
increased
explicitness
is
a
more
complete
exhibition
of
the
various
abstractions
involved
in
the
complex
idea
which
is
the
meaning
of
the
sentence
by
comparison
with
language
we
can
now
see
what
is
the
function
in
thought
which
is
performed
by
pure
mathematics
it
is
a
resolute
attempt
to
go
the
whole
way
in
the
direction
of
complete
analysis
so
as
to
separate
the
elements
of
mere
matter
of
fact
from
the
purely
abstract
conditions
which
they
exemplify
the
habit
of
such
analysis
enlightens
every
act
of
the
functioning
of
the
human
mind
it
first
by
isolating
it
emphasizes
the
direct
aesthetic
appreciation
of
the
content
of
experience
this
direct
appreciation
means
an
apprehension
of
what
this
experience
is
in
itself
in
its
own
particular
essence
including
its
immediate
concrete
values
this
is
a
question
of
direct
experience
dependent
upon
sensitive
subtlety
there
is
then
the
abstraction
of
the
particular
entities
involved
viewed
in
themselves
and
as
apart
from
that
particular
occasion
of
experience
in
which
we
are
then
apprehending
them
lastly
there
is
the
further
apprehension
of
the
absolutely
general
conditions
satisfied
by
the
particular
relations
of
those
entities
as
in
that
experience
these
conditions
gain
their
generality
from
the
fact
that
they
are
expressible
without
reference
to
those
particular
relations
or
to
those
particular
relata
which
occur
in
that
particular
occasion
of
experience
they
are
conditions
which
might
hold
for
an
indefinite
variety
of
other
occasions
involving
other
entities
and
other
relations
between
them
thus
these
conditions
are
perfectly
general
because
they
refer
to
no
particular
occasion
and
to
no
particular
entities
such
as
green
or
blue
or
trees
which
enter
into
a
variety
of
occasions
and
to
no
particular
relationships
between
such
entities
there
is
however
a
limitation
to
be
made
to
the
generality
of
mathematics
it
is
a
qualification
which
applies
equally
to
all
general
statements
no
statement
except
one
can
be
made
respecting
any
remote
occasion
which
enters
into
no
relationship
with
the
immediate
occasion
so
as
to
form
a
constitutive
element
of
the
essence
of
that
immediate
occasion
by
the
â€˜immediate
occasionâ€™
i
mean
that
occasion
which
involves
as
an
ingredient
the
individual
act
of
judgment
in
question
the
one
excepted
statement
is,â€”if
anything
out
of
relationship
then
complete
ignorance
as
to
it
here
by
â€˜ignorance,â€™
i
mean
ignorance
accordingly
no
advice
can
be
given
as
to
how
to
expect
it
or
to
treat
it
in
â€˜practiceâ€™
or
in
any
other
way
either
we
know
something
of
the
remote
occasion
by
the
cognition
which
is
itself
an
element
of
the
immediate
occasion
or
we
know
nothing
accordingly
the
full
universe
disclosed
for
every
variety
of
experience
is
a
universe
in
which
every
detail
enters
into
its
proper
relationship
with
the
immediate
occasion
the
generality
of
mathematics
is
the
most
complete
generality
consistent
with
the
community
of
occasions
which
constitutes
our
metaphysical
situation
it
is
further
to
be
noticed
that
the
particular
entities
require
these
general
conditions
for
their
ingression
into
any
occasions
but
the
same
general
conditions
may
be
required
by
many
types
of
particular
entities
this
fact
that
the
general
conditions
transcend
any
one
set
of
particular
entities
is
the
ground
for
the
entry
into
mathematics
and
into
mathematical
logic
of
the
notion
of
the
â€˜variable.â€™
it
is
by
the
employment
of
this
notion
that
general
conditions
are
investigated
without
any
specification
of
particular
entities
this
irrelevance
of
the
particular
entities
has
not
been
generally
understood:
for
example
the
shape-iness
of
shapes
e.g
circularity
and
sphericity
and
cubicality
as
in
actual
experience
do
not
enter
into
the
geometrical
reasoning
the
exercise
of
logical
reason
is
always
concerned
with
these
absolutely
general
conditions
in
its
broadest
sense
the
discovery
of
mathematics
is
the
discovery
that
the
totality
of
these
general
abstract
conditions
which
are
concurrently
applicable
to
the
relationships
among
the
entities
of
any
one
concrete
occasion
are
themselves
inter-connected
in
the
manner
of
a
pattern
with
a
key
to
it
this
pattern
of
relationships
among
general
abstract
conditions
is
imposed
alike
on
external
reality
and
on
our
abstract
representations
of
it
by
the
general
necessity
that
every
thing
must
be
just
its
own
individual
self
with
its
own
individual
way
of
differing
from
everything
else
this
is
nothing
else
than
the
necessity
of
abstract
logic
which
is
the
presupposition
involved
in
the
very
fact
of
interrelated
existence
as
disclosed
in
each
immediate
occasion
of
experience
the
key
to
the
pattern
means
this
fact:â€”that
from
a
select
set
of
those
general
conditions
exemplified
in
any
one
and
the
same
occasion
a
pattern
involving
an
infinite
variety
of
other
such
conditions
also
exemplified
in
the
same
occasion
can
be
developed
by
the
pure
exercise
of
abstract
logic
any
such
select
set
is
called
the
set
of
postulates
or
premises
from
which
the
reasoning
proceeds
the
reasoning
is
nothing
else
than
the
exhibition
of
the
whole
pattern
of
general
conditions
involved
in
the
pattern
derived
from
the
selected
postulates
the
harmony
of
the
logical
reason
which
divines
the
complete
pattern
as
involved
in
the
postulates
is
the
most
general
aesthetic
property
arising
from
the
mere
fact
of
concurrent
existence
in
the
unity
of
one
occasion
wherever
there
is
a
unity
of
occasion
there
is
thereby
established
an
aesthetic
relationship
between
the
general
conditions
involved
in
that
occasion
this
aesthetic
relationship
is
that
which
is
divined
in
the
exercise
of
rationality
whatever
falls
within
that
relationship
is
thereby
exemplified
in
that
occasion
whatever
falls
without
that
relationship
is
thereby
excluded
from
exemplification
in
that
occasion
the
complete
pattern
of
general
conditions
thus
exemplified
is
determined
by
any
one
of
many
select
sets
of
these
conditions
these
key
sets
are
sets
of
equivalent
postulates
this
reasonable
harmony
of
being
which
is
required
for
the
unity
of
a
complex
occasion
together
with
the
completeness
of
the
realisation
in
that
occasion
of
all
that
is
involved
in
its
logical
harmony
is
the
primary
article
of
metaphysical
doctrine
it
means
that
for
things
to
be
together
involves
that
they
are
reasonably
together
this
means
that
thought
can
penetrate
into
every
occasion
of
fact
so
that
by
comprehending
its
key
conditions
the
whole
complex
of
its
pattern
of
conditions
lies
open
before
it
it
comes
to
this:â€”provided
we
know
something
which
is
perfectly
general
about
the
elements
in
any
occasion
we
can
then
know
an
indefinite
number
of
other
equally
general
concepts
which
must
also
be
exemplified
in
that
same
occasion
the
logical
harmony
involved
in
the
unity
of
an
occasion
is
both
exclusive
and
inclusive
the
occasion
must
exclude
the
inharmonious
and
it
must
include
the
harmonious
pythagoras
was
the
first
man
who
had
any
grasp
of
the
full
sweep
of
this
general
principle
he
lived
in
the
sixth
century
before
christ
our
knowledge
of
him
is
fragmentary
but
we
know
some
points
which
establish
his
greatness
in
the
history
of
thought
he
insisted
on
the
importance
of
the
utmost
generality
in
reasoning
and
he
divined
the
importance
of
number
as
an
aid
to
the
construction
of
any
representation
of
the
conditions
involved
in
the
order
of
nature
we
know
also
that
he
studied
geometry
and
discovered
the
general
proof
of
the
remarkable
theorem
about
right-angled
triangles
the
formation
of
the
pythagorean
brotherhood
and
the
mysterious
rumours
as
to
its
rites
and
its
influence
afford
some
evidence
that
pythagoras
divined
however
dimly
the
possible
importance
of
mathematics
in
the
formation
of
science
on
the
side
of
philosophy
he
started
a
discussion
which
has
agitated
thinkers
ever
since
he
asked
â€˜what
is
the
status
of
mathematical
entities
such
as
numbers
for
example
in
the
realm
of
things?â€™
the
number
â€˜two,â€™
for
example
is
in
some
sense
exempt
from
the
flux
of
time
and
the
necessity
of
position
in
space
yet
it
is
involved
in
the
real
world
the
same
considerations
apply
to
geometrical
notionsâ€”to
circular
shape
for
example
pythagoras
is
said
to
have
taught
that
the
mathematical
entities
such
as
numbers
and
shapes
were
the
ultimate
stuff
out
of
which
the
real
entities
of
our
perceptual
experience
are
constructed
as
thus
boldly
stated
the
idea
seems
crude
and
indeed
silly
but
undoubtedly
he
had
hit
upon
a
philosophical
notion
of
considerable
importance
a
notion
which
has
a
long
history
and
which
has
moved
the
minds
of
men
and
has
even
entered
into
christian
theology
about
a
thousand
years
separate
the
athanasian
creed
from
pythagoras
and
about
two
thousand
four
hundred
years
separate
pythagoras
from
hegel
yet
for
all
these
distances
in
time
the
importance
of
definite
number
in
the
constitution
of
the
divine
nature
and
the
concept
of
the
real
world
as
exhibiting
the
evolution
of
an
idea
can
both
be
traced
back
to
the
train
of
thought
set
going
by
pythagoras
the
importance
of
an
individual
thinker
owes
something
to
chance
for
it
depends
upon
the
fate
of
his
ideas
in
the
minds
of
his
successors
in
this
respect
pythagoras
was
fortunate
his
philosophical
speculations
reach
us
through
the
mind
of
plato
the
platonic
world
of
ideas
is
the
refined
revised
form
of
the
pythagorean
doctrine
that
number
lies
at
the
base
of
the
real
world
owing
to
the
greek
mode
of
representing
numbers
by
patterns
of
dots
the
notions
of
number
and
of
geometrical
configuration
are
less
separated
than
with
us
also
pythagoras
without
doubt
included
the
shape-iness
of
shape
which
is
an
impure
mathematical
entity
so
to-day
when
einstein
and
his
followers
proclaim
that
physical
facts
such
as
gravitation
are
to
be
construed
as
exhibitions
of
local
peculiarities
of
spatio-temporal
properties
they
are
following
the
pure
pythagorean
tradition
in
a
sense
plato
and
pythagoras
stand
nearer
to
modern
physical
science
than
does
aristotle
the
two
former
were
mathematicians
whereas
aristotle
was
the
son
of
a
doctor
though
of
course
he
was
not
thereby
ignorant
of
mathematics
the
practical
counsel
to
be
derived
from
pythagoras
is
to
measure
and
thus
to
express
quality
in
terms
of
numerically
determined
quantity
but
the
biological
sciences
then
and
till
our
own
time
have
been
overwhelmingly
classificatory
accordingly
aristotle
by
his
logic
throws
the
emphasis
on
classification
the
popularity
of
aristotelian
logic
retarded
the
advance
of
physical
science
throughout
the
middle
ages
if
only
the
schoolmen
had
measured
instead
of
classifying
how
much
they
might
have
learnt
classification
is
a
halfway
house
between
the
immediate
concreteness
of
the
individual
thing
and
the
complete
abstraction
of
mathematical
notions
the
species
take
account
of
the
specific
character
and
the
genera
of
the
generic
character
but
in
the
procedure
of
relating
mathematical
notions
to
the
facts
of
nature
by
counting
by
measurement
and
by
geometrical
relations
and
by
types
of
order
the
rational
contemplation
is
lifted
from
the
incomplete
abstractions
involved
in
definite
species
and
genera
to
the
complete
abstractions
of
mathematics
classification
is
necessary
but
unless
you
can
progress
from
classification
to
mathematics
your
reasoning
will
not
take
you
very
far
between
the
epoch
which
stretches
from
pythagoras
to
plato
and
the
epoch
comprised
in
the
seventeenth
century
of
the
modern
world
nearly
two
thousand
years
elapsed
in
this
long
interval
mathematics
had
made
immense
strides
geometry
had
gained
the
study
of
conic
sections
and
trigonometry
the
method
of
exhaustion
had
almost
anticipated
the
integral
calculus
and
above
all
the
arabic
arithmetical
notation
and
algebra
had
been
contributed
by
asiatic
thought
but
the
progress
was
on
technical
lines
mathematics
as
a
formative
element
in
the
development
of
philosophy
never
during
this
long
period
recovered
from
its
deposition
at
the
hands
of
aristotle
some
of
the
old
ideas
derived
from
the
pythagorean-platonic
epoch
lingered
on
and
can
be
traced
among
the
platonic
influences
which
shaped
the
first
period
of
evolution
of
christian
theology
but
philosophy
received
no
fresh
inspiration
from
the
steady
advance
of
mathematical
science
in
the
seventeenth
century
the
influence
of
aristotle
was
at
its
lowest
and
mathematics
recovered
the
importance
of
its
earlier
period
it
was
an
age
of
great
physicists
and
great
philosophers
and
the
physicists
and
philosophers
were
alike
mathematicians
the
exception
of
john
locke
should
be
made
although
he
was
greatly
influenced
by
the
newtonian
circle
of
the
royal
society
in
the
age
of
galileo
descartes
spinoza
newton
and
leibniz
mathematics
was
an
influence
of
the
first
magnitude
in
the
formation
of
philosophic
ideas
but
the
mathematics
which
now
emerged
into
prominence
was
a
very
different
science
from
the
mathematics
of
the
earlier
epoch
it
had
gained
in
generality
and
had
started
upon
its
almost
incredible
modern
career
of
piling
subtlety
of
generalization
upon
subtlety
of
generalization
and
of
finding
with
each
growth
of
complexity
some
new
application
either
to
physical
science
or
to
philosophic
thought
the
arabic
notation
had
equipped
the
science
with
almost
perfect
technical
efficiency
in
the
manipulation
of
numbers
this
relief
from
a
struggle
with
arithmetical
details
as
instanced
for
example
in
the
egyptian
arithmetic
of
b
c
1600
gave
room
for
a
development
which
had
already
been
faintly
anticipated
in
later
greek
mathematics
algebra
now
came
upon
the
scene
and
algebra
is
a
generalisation
of
arithmetic
in
the
same
way
as
the
notion
of
number
abstracted
from
reference
to
any
one
particular
set
of
entities
so
in
algebra
abstraction
is
made
from
the
notion
of
any
particular
numbers
just
as
the
number
â€˜5â€™
refers
impartially
to
any
group
of
five
entities
so
in
algebra
the
letters
are
used
to
refer
impartially
to
any
number
with
the
proviso
that
each
letter
is
to
refer
to
the
same
number
throughout
the
same
context
of
its
employment
this
usage
was
first
employed
in
equations
which
are
methods
of
asking
complicated
arithmetical
questions
in
this
connection
the
letters
representing
numbers
were
termed
â€˜unknowns.â€™
but
equations
soon
suggested
a
new
idea
that
namely
of
a
function
of
one
or
more
general
symbols
these
symbols
being
letters
representing
any
numbers
in
this
employment
the
algebraic
letters
are
called
the
â€˜argumentsâ€™
of
the
function
or
sometimes
they
are
called
the
â€˜variables.â€™
then
for
instance
if
an
angle
is
represented
by
an
algebraical
letter
as
standing
for
its
numerical
measure
in
terms
of
a
given
unit
trigonometry
is
absorbed
into
this
new
algebra
algebra
thus
develops
into
the
general
science
of
analysis
in
which
we
consider
the
properties
of
various
functions
of
undetermined
arguments
finally
the
particular
functions
such
as
the
trigonometrical
functions
and
the
logarithmic
functions
and
the
algebraic
functions
are
generalised
into
the
idea
of
â€˜any
function.â€™
too
large
a
generalisation
leads
to
mere
barrenness
it
is
the
large
generalisation
limited
by
a
happy
particularity
which
is
the
fruitful
conception
for
instance
the
idea
of
any
continuous
function
whereby
the
limitation
of
continuity
is
introduced
is
the
fruitful
idea
which
has
led
to
most
of
the
important
applications
this
rise
of
algebraic
analysis
was
concurrent
with
descartesâ€™
discovery
of
analytical
geometry
and
then
with
the
invention
of
the
infinitesimal
calculus
by
newton
and
leibniz
truly
pythagoras
if
he
could
have
foreseen
the
issue
of
the
train
of
thought
which
he
had
set
going
would
have
felt
himself
fully
justified
in
his
brotherhood
with
its
excitement
of
mysterious
rites
the
point
which
i
now
want
to
make
is
that
this
dominance
of
the
idea
of
functionality
in
the
abstract
sphere
of
mathematics
found
itself
reflected
in
the
order
of
nature
under
the
guise
of
mathematically
expressed
laws
of
nature
apart
from
this
progress
of
mathematics
the
seventeenth
century

of
science
would
have
been

mathematics
supplied
the
background
of

with
which
the

upon
the

those
times
consider
the

fundamental
in

place
in

the

respectively
described
their

galileo

the
periodic

of

explained

as
being

passage
through
it

the
birth
of

depended
upon
the
application
of
the
abstract
idea
of
periodicity
to
a
variety
of
concrete
instances
but
this
would
have
been
impossible
unless
mathematicians
had
already
worked
out
in
the
abstract
the
various
abstract
ideas
which
cluster
round
the
notions
of
periodicity
the
science
of
trigonometry
arose
from
that
of
the
relations
of
the
angles
of
a
right-angled
triangle
to
the
ratios
between
the
sides
and
hypotenuse
of
the
triangle
then
under
the
influence
of
the
newly
discovered
mathematical
science
of
the
analysis
of
functions
it
broadened
out
into
the
study
of
the
simple
abstract
periodic
functions
which
these
ratios
exemplify
thus
trigonometry
became
completely
abstract
and
in
thus
becoming
abstract
it
became
useful
it
illuminated
the
underlying
analogy
between
sets
of
utterly
diverse
physical
phenomena
and
at
the
same
time
it
supplied
the
weapons
by
which
any
one
such
set
could
have
its
various
features
analysed
and
related
to
each
other.[2
nothing
is
more
impressive
than
the
fact
that
as
mathematics
withdrew
increasingly
into
the
upper
regions
of
ever
greater
extremes
of
abstract
thought
it
returned
back
to
earth
with
a
corresponding
growth
of
importance
for
the
analysis
of
concrete
fact
the
history
of
the
seventeenth
century
science
reads
as
though
it
were
some
vivid
dream
of
plato
or
pythagoras
in
this
characteristic
the
seventeenth

was
only
the

newtonâ€™s
direct
influence
on
philosophy
is
best
seen
in
kant
and
not
in
hume
in
the
nineteenth
century
the
general
influence
of
mathematics
waned
the
romantic
movement
in
literature
and
the
idealistic
movement
in
philosophy
were
not
the
products
of
mathematical
minds
also
even
in
science
the
growth
of
geology
of
zoology
and
of
the
biological
sciences
generally
was
in
each
case
entirely
disconnected
from
any
reference
to
mathematics
the
chief
scientific
excitement
of
the
century
was
the
darwinian
theory
of
evolution
accordingly
mathematicians
were
in
the
background
so
far
as
the
general
thought
of
that
age
was
concerned
but
this
does
not
mean
that
mathematics
was
being
neglected
or
even
that
it
was
uninfluential
during
the
nineteenth
century
pure
mathematics
made
almost
as
much
progress
as
during
all
the
preceding
centuries
from
pythagoras
onwards
of
course
progress
was
easier
because
the
technique
had
been
perfected
but
allowing
for
that
the
change
in
mathematics
between
the
years
1800
and
1900
is
very
remarkable
if
we
add
in
the
previous
hundred
years
and
take
the
two
centuries
preceding
the
present
time
one
is
almost
tempted
to
date
the
foundation
of
mathematics
somewhere
in
the
last
quarter
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
period
of
the
discovery
of
the
elements
stretches
from
pythagoras
to
descartes
newton
and
leibniz
and
the
developed
science
has
been
created
during
the
last
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
this
is
not
a
boast
as
to
the
superior
genius
of
the
modern
world
for
it
is
harder
to
discover
the
elements
than
to
develop
the
science
throughout
the
nineteenth
century
the
influence
of
the
science
was
its
influence
on
dynamics
and
physics
and
thence
derivatively
on
engineering
and
chemistry
it
is
difficult
to
overrate
its
indirect
influence
on
human
life
through
the
medium
of
these
sciences
but
there
was
no
direct
influence
of
mathematics
upon
the
general
thought
of
the
age
in
reviewing
this
rapid
sketch
of
the
influence
of
mathematics
throughout
european
history
we
see
that
it
had
two
great
periods
of
direct
influence
upon
general
thought
both
periods
lasting
for
about
two
hundred
years
the
first
period
was
that
stretching
from
pythagoras
to
plato
when
the
possibility
of
the
science
and
its
general
character
first
dawned
upon
the
grecian
thinkers
the
second
period
comprised
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
of
our
modern
epoch
both
periods
had
certain
common
characteristics
in
the
earlier
as
in
the
later
period
the
general
categories
of
thought
in
many
spheres
of
human
interest
were
in
a
state
of
disintegration
in
the
age
of
pythagoras
the
unconscious
paganism
with
its
traditional
clothing
of
beautiful
ritual
and
of
magical
rites
was
passing
into
a
new
phase
under
two
influences
there
were
waves
of
religious
enthusiasm
seeking
direct
enlightenment
into
the
secret
depths
of
being
and
at
the
opposite
pole
there
was
the
awakening
of
critical
analytical
thought
probing
with
cool
dispassionateness
into
ultimate
meanings
in
both
influences
so
diverse
in
their
outcome
there
was
one
common
elementâ€”an
awakened
curiosity
and
a
movement
towards
the
reconstruction
of
traditional
ways
the
pagan
mysteries
may
be
compared
to
the
puritan
reaction
and
to
the
catholic
reaction
critical
scientific
interest
was
alike
in
both
epochs
though
with
minor
differences
of
substantial
importance
in
each
age
the
earlier
stages
were
placed
in
periods
of
rising
prosperity
and
of
new
opportunities
in
this
respect
they
differed
from
the
period
of
gradual
declension
in
the
second
and
third
centuries
when
christianity
was
advancing
to
the
conquest
of
the
roman
world
it
is
only
in
a
period
fortunate
both
in
its
opportunities
for
disengagement
from
the
immediate
pressure
of
circumstances
and
in
its
eager
curiosity
that
the
age-spirit
can
undertake
any
direct
revision
of
those
final
abstractions
which
lie
hidden
in
the
more
concrete
concepts
from
which
the
serious
thought
of
an
age
takes
its
start
in
the
rare
periods
when
this
task
can
be
undertaken
mathematics
becomes
relevant
to
philosophy
for
mathematics
is
the
science
of
the
most
complete
abstractions
to
which
the
human
mind
can
attain
the
parallel
between
the
two
epochs
must
not
be
pressed
too
far
the
modern
world
is
larger
and
more
complex
than
the
ancient
civilization
round
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
or
even
than
that
of
the
europe
which
sent
columbus
and
the
pilgrim
fathers
across
the
ocean
we
cannot
now
explain
our
age
by
some
simple
formula
which
becomes
dominant
and
will
then
be
laid
to
rest
for
a
thousand
years
thus
the
temporary
submergence
of
the
mathematical
mentality
from
the
time
of
rousseau
onwards
appears
already
to
be
at
an
end
we
are
entering
upon
an
age
of
reconstruction
in
religion
in
science
and
in
political
thought
such
ages
if
they
are
to
avoid
mere
ignorant
oscillation
between
extremes
must
seek
truth
in
its
ultimate
depths
there
can
be
no
vision
of
this
depth
of
truth
apart
from
a
philosophy
which
takes
full
account
of
those
ultimate
abstractions
whose
interconnections
it
is
the
business
of
mathematics
to
explore
in
order
to
explain
exactly
how
mathematics
is
gaining
in
general
importance
at
the
present
time
let
us
start
from
a
particular
scientific
perplexity
and
consider
the
notions
to
which
we
are
naturally
led
by
some
attempt
to
unravel
its
difficulties
at
present
physics
is
troubled
by
the
quantum
theory
i
need
not
now
explain[3
what
this
theory
is
to
those
who
are
not
already
familiar
with
it
but
the
point
is
that
one
of
the
most
hopeful
lines
of
explanation
is
to
assume
that
an
electron
does
not
continuously
traverse
its
path
in
space
the
alternative
notion
as
to
its
mode
of
existence
is
that
it
appears
at
a
series
of
discrete
positions
in
space
which
it
occupies
for
successive
durations
of
time
it
is
as
though
an
automobile
moving
at
the
average
rate
of
thirty
miles
an
hour
along
a
road
did
not
traverse
the
road
continuously
but
appeared
successively
at
the
successive
milestones
remaining
for
two
minutes
at
each
milestone

chapter
viii
in
the
first
place
there
is
required
the
purely
technical
use
of
mathematics
to
determine
whether
this
conception
does
in
fact
explain
the
many
perplexing
characteristics
of
the
quantum
theory
if
the
notion
survives
this
test
undoubtedly
physics
will
adopt
it
so
far
the
question
is
purely
one
for
mathematics
and
physical
science
to
settle
between
them
on
the
basis
of
mathematical
calculations
and
physical
observations
but
now
a
problem
is
handed
over
to
the
philosophers
this
discontinuous
existence
in
space
thus
assigned
to
electrons
is
very
unlike
the
continuous
existence
of
material
entities
which
we
habitually
assume
as
obvious
the
electron
seems
to
be
borrowing
the
character
which
some
people
have
assigned
to
the
mahatmas
of
tibet
these
electrons
with
the
correlative
protons
are
now
conceived
as
being
the
fundamental
entities
out
of
which
the
material
bodies
of
ordinary
experience
are
composed
accordingly
if
this
explanation
is
allowed
we
have
to
revise
all
our
notions
of
the
ultimate
character
of
material
existence
for
when
we
penetrate
to
these
final
entities
this
startling
discontinuity
of
spatial
existence
discloses
itself
there
is
no
difficulty
in
explaining
the
paradox
if
we
consent
to
apply
to
the
apparently
steady
undifferentiated
endurance
of
matter
the
same
principles
as
those
now
accepted
for
sound
and
light
a
steadily
sounding
note
is
explained
as
the
outcome
of
vibrations
in
the
air:
a
steady
colour
is
explained
as
the
outcome
of
vibrations
in
ether
if
we
explain
the
steady
endurance
of
matter
on
the
same
principle
we
shall
conceive
each
primordial
element
as
a
vibratory
ebb
and
flow
of
an
underlying
energy
or
activity
suppose
we
keep
to
the
physical
idea
of
energy:
then
each
primordial
element
will
be
an
organized
system
of
vibratory
streaming
of
energy
accordingly
there
will
be
a
definite
period
associated
with
each
element
and
within
that
period
the
stream-system
will
sway
from
one
stationary
maximum
to
another
stationary
maximum,â€”or
taking
a
metaphor
from
the
ocean
tides
the
system
will
sway
from
one
high
tide
to
another
high
tide
this
system
forming
the
primordial
element
is
nothing
at
any
instant
it
requires
its
whole
period
in
which
to
manifest
itself
in
an
analogous
way
a
note
of
music
is
nothing
at
an
instant
but
it
also
requires
its
whole
period
in
which
to
manifest
itself
accordingly
in
asking
where
the
primordial
element
is
we
must
settle
on
its
average
position
at
the
centre
of
each
period
if
we
divide
time
into
smaller
elements
the
vibratory
system
as
one
electronic
entity
has
no
existence
the
path
in
space
of
such
a
vibratory
entityâ€”where
the
entity
is
constituted
by
the
vibrationsâ€”must
be
represented
by
a
series
of
detached
positions
in
space
analogously
to
the
automobile
which
is
found
at
successive
milestones
and
at
nowhere
between
we
first
must
ask
whether
there
is
any
evidence
to
associate
the
quantum
theory
with
vibration
this
question
is
immediately
answered
in
the
affirmative
the
whole
theory
centres
round
the
radiant
energy
from
an
atom
and
is
intimately
associated
with
the
periods
of
the
radiant
wave-systems
it
seems
therefore
that
the
hypothesis
of
essentially
vibratory
existence
is
the
most
hopeful
way
of
explaining
the
paradox
of
the
discontinuous
orbit
in
the
second
place
a
new
problem
is
now
placed
before
philosophers
and
physicists
if
we
entertain
the
hypothesis
that
the
ultimate
elements
of
matter
are
in
their
essence
vibratory
by
this
i
mean
that
apart
from
being
a
periodic
system
such
an
element
would
have
no
existence
with
this
hypothesis
we
have
to
ask
what
are
the
ingredients
which
form
the
vibratory
organism
we
have
already
got
rid
of
the
matter
with
its
appearance
of
undifferentiated
endurance
apart
from
some
metaphysical
compulsion
there
is
no
reason
to
provide
another
more
subtle
stuff
to
take
the
place
of
the
matter
which
has
just
been
explained
away
the
field
is
now
open
for
the
introduction
of
some
new
doctrine
of
organism
which
may
take
the
place
of
the
materialism
with
which
since
the
seventeenth
century
science
has
saddled
philosophy
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
physicistsâ€™
energy
is
obviously
an
abstraction
the
concrete
fact
which
is
the
organism
must
be
a
complete
expression
of
the
character
of
a
real
occurrence
such
a
displacement
of
scientific
materialism
if
it
ever
takes
place
cannot
fail
to
have
important
consequences
in
every
field
of
thought
finally
our
last
reflection
must
be
that
we
have
in
the
end
come
back
to
a
version
of
the
doctrine
of
old
pythagoras
from
whom
mathematics
and
mathematical
physics
took
their
rise
he
discovered
the
importance
of
dealing
with
abstractions
and
in
particular
directed
attention
to
number
as
characterizing
the
periodicities
of
notes
of
music
the
importance
of
the
abstract
idea
of
periodicity
was
thus
present
at
the
very
beginning
both
of
mathematics
and
of
european
philosophy
in
the
seventeenth
century
the
birth
of
modern
science
required
a
new
mathematics
more
fully
equipped
for
the
purpose
of
analysing
the
characteristics
of
vibratory
existence
and
now
in
the
twentieth
century
we
find
physicists
largely
engaged
in
analysing
the
periodicities
of
atoms
truly
pythagoras
in
founding
european
philosophy
and
european
mathematics
endowed
them
with
the
luckiest
of
lucky
guessesâ€”or
was
it
a
flash
of
divine
genius
penetrating
to
the
inmost
nature
of
things?
chapter
iii
the
century
of
genius
the
previous
chapters
were
devoted
to
the
antecedent
conditions
which
prepared
the
soil
for
the
scientific
outburst
of
the
seventeenth
century
they
traced
the
various
elements
of
thought
and
instinctive
belief
from
their
first
efflorescence
in
the
classical
civilisation
of
the
ancient
world
through
the
transformations
which
they
underwent
in
the
middle
ages
up
to
the
historical
revolt
of
the
sixteenth
century
three
main
factors
arrested
attention,â€”the
rise
of
mathematics
the
instinctive
belief
in
a
detailed
order
of
nature
and
the
unbridled
rationalism
of
the
thought
of
the
later
middle
ages
by
this
rationalism
i
mean
the
belief
that
the
avenue
to
truth
was
predominantly
through
a
metaphysical
analysis
of
the
nature
of
things
which
would
thereby
determine
how
things
acted
and
functioned
the
historical
revolt
was
the
definite
abandonment
of
this
method
in
favour
of
the
study
of
the
empirical
facts
of
antecedents
and
consequences
in
religion
it
meant
the
appeal
to
the
origins
of
christianity
and
in
science
it
meant
the
appeal
to
experiment
and
the
inductive
method
of
reasoning
a
brief
and
sufficiently
accurate
description
of
the
intellectual
life
of
the
european
races
during
the
succeeding
two
centuries
and
a
quarter
up
to
our
own
times
is
that
they
have
been
living
upon
the
accumulated
capital
of
ideas
provided
for
them
by
the
genius
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
men
of
this
epoch
inherited
a
ferment
of
ideas
attendant
upon
the
historical
revolt
of
the
sixteenth
century
and
they
bequeathed
formed
systems
of
thought
touching
every
aspect
of
human
life
it
is
the
one
century
which
consistently
and
throughout
the
whole
range
of
human
activities
provided
intellectual
genius
adequate
for
the
greatness
of
its
occasions
the
crowded
stage
of
this
hundred
years
is
indicated
by
the
coincidences
which
mark
its
literary
annals
at
its
dawn
baconâ€™s
advancement
of
learning
and
cervantesâ€™
don
quixote
were
published
in
the
same
year
1605
as
though
the
epoch
would
introduce
itself
with
a
forward
and
a
backward
glance
the
first
quarto
edition
of
hamlet
appeared
in
the
preceding
year
and
a
slightly
variant
edition
in
the
same
year
finally
shakespeare
and
cervantes
died
on
the
same
day
april
23
1616
in
the
spring
of
this
same
year
harvey
is
believed
to
have
first
expounded
his
theory
of
the
circulation
of
the
blood
in
a
course
of
lectures
before
the
college
of
physicians
in
london
newton
was
born
in
the
year
that
galileo
died
1642
exactly
one
hundred
years
after
the
publication
of
copernicusâ€™
de
revolutionibus
one
year
earlier
descartes
published
his
meditationes
and
two
years
later
his
principia
philosophiae
there
simply
was
not
time
for
the
century
to
space
out
nicely
its
notable
events
concerning
men
of
genius
i
cannot
now
enter
upon
a
chronicle
of
the
various
stages
of
intellectual
advance
included
within
this
epoch
it
is
too
large
a
topic
for
one
lecture
and
would
obscure
the
ideas
which
it
is
my
purpose
to
develop
a
mere
rough
catalogue
of
some
names
will
be
sufficient
names
of
men
who
published
to
the
world
important
work
within
these
limits
of
time:
francis
bacon
harvey
kepler
galileo
descartes
pascal
huyghens
boyle
newton
locke
spinoza
leibniz
i
have
limited
the
list
to
the
sacred
number
of
twelve
a
number
much
too
small
to
be
properly
representative
for
example
there
is
only
one
italian
there
whereas
italy
could
have
filled
the
list
from
its
own
ranks
again
harvey
is
the
only
biologist
and
also
there
are
too
many
englishmen
this
latter
defect
is
partly
due
to
the
fact
that
the
lecturer
is
english
and
that
he
is
lecturing
to
an
audience
which
equally
with
him
owns
this
english
century
if
he
had
been
dutch
there
would
have
been
too
many
dutchmen
if
italian
too
many
italians
and
if
french
too
many
frenchmen
the
unhappy
thirty
yearsâ€™
war
was
devastating
germany
but
every
other
country
looks
back
to
this
century
as
an
epoch
which
witnessed
some
culmination
of
its
genius
certainly
this
was
a
great
period
of
english
thought
as
at
a
later
time
voltaire
impressed
upon
france
the
omission
of
physiologists
other
than
harvey
also
requires
explanation
there
were
of
course
great
advances
in
biology
within
the
century
chiefly
associated
with
italy
and
the
university
of
padua
but
my
purpose
is
to
trace
the
philosophic
outlook
derived
from
science
and
presupposed
by
science
and
to
estimate
some
of
its
effects
on
the
general
climate
of
each
age
now
the
scientific
philosophy
of
this
age
was
dominated
by
physics
so
as
to
be
the
most
obvious
rendering
in
terms
of
general
ideas
of
the
state
of
physical
knowledge
of
that
age
and
of
the
two
succeeding
centuries
as
a
matter
of
fact
these
concepts
are
very
unsuited
to
biology
and
set
for
it
an
insoluble
problem
of
matter
and
life
and
organism
with
which
biologists
are
now
wrestling
but
the
science
of
living
organisms
is
only
now
coming
to
a
growth
adequate
to
impress
its
conceptions
upon
philosophy
the
last
half
century
before
the
present
time
has
witnessed
unsuccessful
attempts
to
impress
biological
notions
upon
the
materialism
of
the
seventeenth
century
however
this
success
be
estimated
it
is
certain
that
the
root
ideas
of
the
seventeenth
century
were
derived
from
the
school
of
thought
which
produced
galileo
huyghens
and
newton
and
not
from
the
physiologists
of
padua
one
unsolved
problem
of
thought
so
far
as
it
derives
from
this
period
is
to
be
formulated
thus:
given
configurations
of
matter
with
locomotion
in
space
as
assigned
by
physical
laws
to
account
for
living
organisms
my
discussion
of
the
epoch
will
be
best
introduced
by
a
quotation
from
francis
bacon
which
forms
the
opening
of
section
or
â€˜centuryâ€™
ix
of
his
natural
history
i
mean
his
silva
silvarum
we
are
told
in
the
contemporary
memoir
by
his
chaplain
dr
rawley
that
this
work
was
composed
in
the
last
five
years
of
his
life
so
it
must
be
dated
between
1620
and
1626
the
quotation
runs
thus:
â€œit
is
certain
that
all
bodies
whatsoever
though
they
have
no
sense
yet
they
have
perception
for
when
one
body
is
applied
to
another
there
is
a
kind
of
election
to
embrace
that
which
is
agreeable
and
to
exclude
or
expel
that
which
is
ingrate
and
whether
the
body
be
alterant
or
altered
evermore
a
perception
precedeth
operation
for
else
all
bodies
would
be
like
one
to
another
and
sometimes
this
perception
in
some
kind
of
bodies
is
far
more
subtile
than
sense
so
that
sense
is
but
a
dull
thing
in
comparison
of
it:
we
see
a
weatherglass
will
find
the
least
difference
of
the
weather
in
heat
or
cold
when
we
find
it
not
and
this
perception
is
sometimes
at
a
distance
as
well
as
upon
the
touch
as
when
the
loadstone
draweth
iron
or
flame
naphtha
of
babylon
a
great
distance
off
it
is
therefore
a
subject
of
a
very
noble
enquiry
to
enquire
of
the
more
subtile
perceptions
for
it
is
another
key
to
open
nature
as
well
as
the
sense
and
sometimes
better
and
besides
it
is
a
principal
means
of
natural
divination
for
that
which
in
these
perceptions
appeareth
early
in
the
great
effects
cometh
long
after.â€
there
are
a
great
many
points
of
interest
about
this
quotation
some
of
which
will
emerge
into
importance
in
succeeding
lectures
in
the
first
place
note
the
careful
way
in
which
bacon
discriminates
between
perception
or
taking
account
of
on
the
one
hand
and
sense
or
cognitive
experience
on
the
other
hand
in
this
respect
bacon
is
outside
the
physical
line
of
thought
which
finally
dominated
the
century
later
on
people
thought
of
passive
matter
which
was
operated
on
externally
by
forces
i
believe
baconâ€™s
line
of
thought
to
have
expressed
a
more
fundamental
truth
than
do
the
materialistic
concepts
which
were
then
being
shaped
as
adequate
for
physics
we
are
now
so
used
to
the
materialistic
way
of
looking
at
things
which
has
been
rooted
in
our
literature
by
the
genius
of
the
seventeenth
century
that
it
is
with
some
difficulty
that
we
understand
the
possibility
of
another
mode
of
approach
to
the
problems
of
nature
in
the
particular
instance
of
the
quotation
which
i
have
just
made
the
whole
passage
and
the
context
in
which
it
is
embedded
are
permeated
through
and
through
by
the
experimental
method
that
is
to
say
by
attention
to
â€˜irreducible
and
stubborn
factsâ€™
and
by
the
inductive
method
of
eliciting
general
laws
another
unsolved
problem
which
has
been
bequeathed
to
us
by
the
seventeenth
century
is
the
rational
justification
of
this
method
of
induction
the
explicit
realisation
of
the
antithesis
between
the
deductive
rationalism
of
the
scholastics
and
the
inductive
observational
methods
of
the
moderns
must
chiefly
be
ascribed
to
bacon
though
of
course
it
was
implicit
in
the
mind
of
galileo
and
of
all
the
men
of
science
of
those
times
but
bacon
was
one
of
the
earliest
of
the
whole
group
and
also
had
the
most
direct
apprehension
of
the
full
extent
of
the
intellectual
revolution
which
was
in
progress
perhaps
the
man
who
most
completely
anticipated
both
bacon
and
the
whole
modern
point
of
view
was
the
artist
leonardo
da
vinci
who
lived
almost
exactly
a
century
before
bacon
leonardo
also
illustrates
the
theory
which
i
was
advancing
in
my
last
lecture
that
the
rise
of
naturalistic
art
was
an
important
ingredient
in
the
formation
of
our
scientific
mentality
indeed
leonardo
was
more
completely
a
man
of
science
than
was
bacon
the
practice
of
naturalistic
art
is
more
akin
to
the
practice
of
physics
chemistry
and
biology
than
is
the
practice
of
law
we
all
remember
the
saying
of
baconâ€™s
contemporary
harvey
the
discoverer
of
the
circulation
of
the
blood
that
bacon
â€˜wrote
of
science
like
a
lord
chancellor.â€™
but
at
the
beginning
of
the
modern
period
da
vinci
and
bacon
stand
together
as
illustrating
the
various
strains
which
have
combined
to
form
the
modern
world
namely
legal
mentality
and
the
patient
observational
habits
of
the
naturalistic
artists
in
the
passage
which
i
have
quoted
from
baconâ€™s
writings
there
is
no
explicit
mention
of
the
method
of
inductive
reasoning
it
is
unnecessary
for
me
to
prove
to
you
by
any
quotations
that
the
enforcement
of
the
importance
of
this
method
and
of
the
importance
to
the
welfare
of
mankind
of
the
secrets
of
nature
to
be
thus
discovered
was
one
of
the
main
themes
to
which
bacon
devoted
himself
in
his
writings
induction
has
proved
to
be
a
somewhat
more
complex
process
than
bacon
anticipated
he
had
in
his
mind
the
belief
that
with
a
sufficient
care
in
the
collection
of
instances
the
general
law
would
stand
out
of
itself
we
know
now
and
probably
harvey
knew
then
that
this
is
a
very
inadequate
account
of
the
processes
which
issue
in
scientific
generalisations
but
when
you
have
made
all
the
requisite
deductions
bacon
remains
as
one
of
the
great
builders
who
constructed
the
mind
of
the
modern
world
the
special
difficulties
raised
by
induction
emerged
in
the
eighteenth
century
as
the
result
of
humeâ€™s
criticism
but
bacon
was
one
of
the
prophets
of
the
historical
revolt
which
deserted
the
method
of
unrelieved
rationalism
and
rushed
into
the
other
extreme
of
basing
all
fruitful
knowledge
upon
inference
from
particular
occasions
in
the
past
to
particular
occasions
in
the
future
i
do
not
wish
to
throw
any
doubt
upon
the
validity
of
induction
when
it
has
been
properly
guarded
my
point
is
that
the
very
baffling
task
of
applying
reason
to
elicit
the
general
characteristics
of
the
immediate
occasion
as
set
before
us
in
direct
cognition
is
a
necessary
preliminary
if
we
are
to
justify
induction
unless
indeed
we
are
content
to
base
it
upon
our
vague
instinct
that
of
course
it
is
all
right
either
there
is
something
about
the
immediate
occasion
which
affords
knowledge
of
the
past
and
the
future
or
we
are
reduced
to
utter
scepticism
as
to
memory
and
induction
it
is
impossible
to
over-emphasise
the
point
that
the
key
to
the
process
of
induction
as
used
either
in
science
or
in
our
ordinary
life
is
to
be
found
in
the
right
understanding
of
the
immediate
occasion
of
knowledge
in
its
full
concreteness
it
is
in
respect
to
our
grasp
of
the
character
of
these
occasions
in
their
concreteness
that
the
modern
developments
of
physiology
and
of
psychology
are
of
critical
importance
i
shall
illustrate
this
point
in
my
subsequent
lectures
we
find
ourselves
amid
insoluble
difficulties
when
we
substitute
for
this
concrete
occasion
a
mere
abstract
in
which
we
only
consider
material
objects
in
a
flux
of
configurations
in
time
and
space
it
is
quite
obvious
that
such
objects
can
tell
us
only
that
they
are
where
they
are
accordingly
we
must
recur
to
the
method
of
the
school-divinity
as
explained
by
the
italian
medievalists
whom
i
quoted
in
the
first
lecture
we
must
observe
the
immediate
occasion
and
use
reason
to
elicit
a
general
description
of
its
nature
induction
presupposes
metaphysics
in
other
words
it
rests
upon
an
antecedent
rationalism
you
cannot
have
a
rational
justification
for
your
appeal
to
history
till
your
metaphysics
has
assured
you
that
there
is
a
history
to
appeal
to
and
likewise
your
conjectures
as
to
the
future
presuppose
some
basis
of
knowledge
that
there
is
a
future
already
subjected
to
some
determinations
the
difficulty
is
to
make
sense
of
either
of
these
ideas
but
unless
you
have
done
so
you
have
made
nonsense
of
induction
you
will
observe
that
i
do
not
hold
induction
to
be
in
its
essence
the
derivation
of
general
laws
it
is
the
divination
of
some
characteristics
of
a
particular
future
from
the
known
characteristics
of
a
particular
past
the
wider
assumption
of
general
laws
holding
for
all
cognisable
occasions
appears
a
very
unsafe
addendum
to
attach
to
this
limited
knowledge
all
we
can
ask
of
the
present
occasion
is
that
it
shall
determine
a
particular
community
of
occasions
which
are
in
some
respects
mutually
qualified
by
reason
of
their
inclusion
within
that
same
community
that
community
of
occasions
considered
in
physical
science
is
the
set
of
happenings
which
fit
on
to
each
otherâ€”as
we
sayâ€”in
a
common
space-time
so
that
we
can
trace
the
transitions
from
one
to
the
other
accordingly
we
refer
to
the
common
space-time
indicated
in
our
immediate
occasion
of
knowledge
inductive
reasoning
proceeds
from
the
particular
occasion
to
the
particular
community
of
occasions
and
from
the
particular
community
to
relations
between
particular
occasions
within
that
community
until
we
have
taken
into
account
other
scientific
concepts
it
is
impossible
to
carry
the
discussion
of
induction
further
than
this
preliminary
conclusion
the
third
point
to
notice
about
this
quotation
from
bacon
is
the
purely
qualitative
character
of
the
statements
made
in
it
in
this
respect
bacon
completely
missed
the
tonality
which
lay
behind
the
success
of
seventeenth
century
science
science
was
becoming
and
has
remained
primarily
quantitative
search
for
measurable
elements
among
your
phenomena
and
then
search
for
relations
between
these
measures
of
physical
quantities
bacon
ignores
this
rule
of
science
for
example
in
the
quotation
given
he
speaks
of
action
at
a
distance
but
he
is
thinking
qualitatively
and
not
quantitatively
we
cannot
ask
that
he
should
anticipate
his
younger
contemporary
galileo
or
his
distant
successor
newton
but
he
gives
no
hint
that
there
should
be
a
search
for
quantities
perhaps
he
was
misled
by
the
current
logical
doctrines
which
had
come
down
from
aristotle
for
in
effect
these
doctrines
said
to
the
physicist
â€˜_classify_â€™
when
they
should
have
said
â€˜_measure_.â€™
by
the
end
of
the
century
physics
had
been
founded
on
a
satisfactory
basis
of
measurement
the
final
and
adequate
exposition
was
given
by
newton
the
common
measurable
element
of
mass
was
discerned
as
characterising
all
bodies
in
different
amounts
bodies
which
are
apparently
identical
in
substance
shape
and
size
have
very
approximately
the
same
mass:
the
closer
the
identity
the
nearer
the
equality
the
force
acting
on
a
body
whether
by
touch
or
by
action
at
a
distance
was
in
effect
defined
as
being
equal
to
the
mass
of
the
body
multiplied
by
the
rate
of
change
of
the
bodyâ€™s
velocity
so
far
as
this
rate
of
change
is
produced
by
that
force
in
this
way
the
force
is
discerned
by
its
effect
on
the
motion
of
the
body
the
question
now
arises
whether
this
conception
of
the
magnitude
of
a
force
leads
to
the
discovery
of
simple
quantitative
laws
involving
the
alternative
determination
of
forces
by
circumstances
of
the
configuration
of
substances
and
of
their
physical
characters
the
newtonian
conception
has
been
brilliantly
successful
in
surviving
this
test
throughout
the
whole
modern
period
its
first
triumph
was
the
law
of
gravitation
its
cumulative
triumph
has
been
the
whole
development
of
dynamical
astronomy
of
engineering
and
of
physics
this
subject
of
the
formation
of
the
three
laws
of
motion
and
of
the
law
of
gravitation
deserves
critical
attention
the
whole
development
of
thought
occupied
exactly
two
generations
it
commenced
with
galileo
and
ended
with
newtonâ€™s
principia
and
newton
was
born
in
the
year
that
galileo
died
also
the
lives
of
descartes
and
huyghens
fall
within
the
period
occupied
by
these
great
terminal
figures
the
issue
of
the
combined
labours
of
these
four
men
has
some
right
to
be
considered
as
the
greatest
single
intellectual
success
which
mankind
has
achieved
in
estimating
its
size
we
must
consider
the
completeness
of
its
range
it
constructs
for
us
a
vision
of
the
material
universe
and
it
enables
us
to
calculate
the
minutest
detail
of
a
particular
occurrence
galileo
took
the
first
step
in
hitting
on
the
right
line
of
thought
he
noted
that
the
critical
point
to
attend
to
was
not
the
motion
of
bodies
but
the
changes
of
their
motions
galileoâ€™s
discovery
is
formularised
by
newton
in
his
first
law
of
motion:â€”â€œevery
body
continues
in
its
state
of
rest
or
of
uniform
motion
in
a
straight
line
except
so
far
as
it
may
be
compelled
by
force
to
change
that
state.â€
this
formula
contains
the
repudiation
of
a
belief
which
had
blocked
the
progress
of
physics
for
two
thousand
years
it
also
deals
with
a
fundamental
concept
which
is
essential
to
scientific
theory
i
mean
the
concept
of
an
ideally
isolated
system
this
conception
embodies
a
fundamental
character
of
things
without
which
science
or
indeed
any
knowledge
on
the
part
of
finite
intellects
would
be
impossible
the
â€˜isolatedâ€™
system
is
not
a
solipsist
system
apart
from
which
there
would
be
nonentity
it
is
isolated
as
within
the
universe
this
means
that
there
are
truths
respecting
this
system
which
require
reference
only
to
the
remainder
of
things
by
way
of
a
uniform
systematic
scheme
of
relationships
thus
the
conception
of
an
isolated
system
is
not
the
conception
of
substantial
independence
from
the
remainder
of
things
but
of
freedom
from
casual
contingent
dependence
upon
detailed
items
within
the
rest
of
the
universe
further
this
freedom
from
casual
dependence
is
required
only
in
respect
to
certain
abstract
characteristics
which
attach
to
the
isolated
system
and
not
in
respect
to
the
system
in
its
full
concreteness
the
first
law
of
motion
asks
what
is
to
be
said
of
a
dynamically
isolated
system
so
far
as
concerns
its
motion
as
a
whole
abstracting
from
its
orientation
and
its
internal
arrangement
of
parts
aristotle
said
that
you
must
conceive
such
a
system
to
be
at
rest
galileo
added
that
the
state
of
rest
is
only
a
particular
case
and
that
the
general
statement
is
â€˜either
in
a
state
of
rest
or
of
uniform
motion
in
a
straight
line.â€™
accordingly
an
aristotelean
would
conceive
the
forces
arising
from
the
reaction
of
alien
bodies
as
being
quantitatively
measurable
in
terms
of
the
velocity
they
sustain
and
as
directively
determined
by
the
direction
of
that
velocity
while
the
galilean
would
direct
attention
to
the
magnitude
of
the
acceleration
and
to
its
direction
this
difference
is
illustrated
by
contrasting
kepler
and
newton
they
both
speculated
as
to
the
forces
sustaining
the
planets
in
their
orbits
kepler
looked
for
tangential
forces
pushing
the
planets
along
whereas
newton
looked
for
radial
forces
diverting
the
directions
of
the
planetsâ€™
motions
instead
of
dwelling
upon
the
mistake
which
aristotle
made
it
is
more
profitable
to
emphasise
the
justification
which
he
had
for
it
if
we
consider
the
obvious
facts
of
our
experience
all
the
motions
which
enter
into
our
normal
everyday
experience
cease
unless
they
are
evidently
sustained
from
the
outside
apparently
therefore
the
sound
empiricist
must
devote
his
attention
to
this
question
of
the
sustenance
of
motion
we
here
hit
upon
one
of
the
dangers
of
unimaginative
empiricism
the
seventeenth
century
exhibits
another
example
of
this
same
danger
and
of
all
people
in
the
world
newton
fell
into
it
huyghens
had
produced
the
wave
theory
of
light
but
this
theory
failed
to
account
for
the
most
obvious
facts
about
light
as
in
our
ordinary
experience
namely
that
shadows
cast
by
obstructing
objects
are
defined
by
rectilinear
rays
accordingly
newton
rejected
this
theory
and
adopted
the
corpuscular
theory
which
completely
explained
shadows
since
then
both
theories
have
had
their
periods
of
triumph
at
the
present
moment
the
scientific
world
is
seeking
for
a
combination
of
the
two
these
examples
illustrate
the
danger
of
refusing
to
entertain
an
idea
because
of
its
failure
to
explain
one
of
the
most
obvious
facts
in
the
subject
matter
in
question
if
you
have
had
your
attention
directed
to
the
novelties
in
thought
in
your
own
lifetime
you
will
have
observed
that
almost
all
really
new
ideas
have
a
certain
aspect
of
foolishness
when
they
are
first
produced
returning
to
the
laws
of
motion
it
is
noticeable
that
no
reason
was
produced
in
the
seventeenth
century
for
the
galilean
as
distinct
from
the
aristotelian
position
it
was
an
ultimate
fact
when
in
the
course
of
these
lectures
we
come
to
the
modern
period
we
shall
see
that
the
theory
of
relativity
throws
complete
light
on
this
question
but
only
by
rearranging
our
whole
ideas
as
to
space
and
time
it
remained
for
newton
to
direct
attention
to
mass
as
a
physical
quantity
inherent
in
the
nature
of
a
material
body
mass
remained
permanent
during
all
changes
of
motion
but
the
proof
of
the
permanence
of
mass
amid
chemical
transformations
had
to
wait
for
lavoisier
a
century
later
newtonâ€™s
next
task
was
to
find
some
estimate
of
the
magnitude
of
the
alien
force
in
terms
of
the
mass
of
the
body
and
of
its
acceleration
he
here
had
a
stroke
of
luck
for
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
mathematician
the
simplest
possible
law
namely
the
product
of
the
two
proved
to
be
the
successful
one
again
the
modern
relativity
theory
modifies
this
extreme
simplicity
but
luckily
for
science
the
delicate
experiments
of
the
physicists
of
to-day
were
not
then
known
or
even
possible
accordingly
the
world
was
given
the
two
centuries
which
it
required
in
order
to
digest
newtonâ€™s
laws
of
motion
having
regard
to
this
triumph
can
we
wonder
that
scientists
placed
their
ultimate
principles
upon
a
materialistic
basis
and
thereafter
ceased
to
worry
about
philosophy?
we
shall
grasp
the
course
of
thought
if
we
understand
exactly
what
this
basis
is
and
what
difficulties
it
finally
involves
when
you
are
criticising
the
philosophy
of
an
epoch
do
not
chiefly
direct
your
attention
to
those
intellectual
positions
which
its
exponents
feel
it
necessary
explicitly
to
defend
there
will
be
some
fundamental
assumptions
which
adherents
of
all
the
variant
systems
within
the
epoch
unconsciously
presuppose
such
assumptions
appear
so
obvious
that
people
do
not
know
what
they
are
assuming
because
no
other
way
of
putting
things
has
ever
occurred
to
them
with
these
assumptions
a
certain
limited
number
of
types
of
philosophic
systems
are
possible
and
this
group
of
systems
constitutes
the
philosophy
of
the
epoch
one
such
assumption
underlies
the
whole
philosophy
of
nature
during
the
modern
period
it
is
embodied
in
the
conception
which
is
supposed
to
express
the
most
concrete
aspect
of
nature
the
ionian
philosophers
asked
what
is
nature
made
of?
the
answer
is
couched
in
terms
of
stuff
or
matter
or
material,â€”the
particular
name
chosen
is
indifferentâ€”which
has
the
property
of
simple
location
in
space
and
time
or
if
you
adopt
the
more
modern
ideas
in
space-time
what
i
mean
by
matter
or
material
is
anything
which
has
this
property
of
simple
location
by
simple
location
i
mean
one
major
characteristic
which
refers
equally
both
to
space
and
to
time
and
other
minor
characteristics
which
are
diverse
as
between
space
and
time
the
characteristic
common
both
to
space
and
time
is
that
material
can
be
said
to
be
here
in
space
and
here
in
time
or
here
in
space-time
in
a
perfectly
definite
sense
which
does
not
require
for
its
explanation
any
reference
to
other
regions
of
space-time
curiously
enough
this
character
of
simple
location
holds
whether
we
look
on
a
region
of
space-time
as
determined
absolutely
or
relatively
for
if
a
region
is
merely
a
way
of
indicating
a
certain
set
of
relations
to
other
entities
then
this
characteristic
which
i
call
simple
location
is
that
material
can
be
said
to
have
just
these
relations
of
position
to
the
other
entities
without
requiring
for
its
explanation
any
reference
to
other
regions
constituted
by
analogous
relations
of
position
to
the
same
entities
in
fact
as
soon
as
you
have
settled
however
you
do
settle
what
you
mean
by
a
definite
place
in
space-time
you
can
adequately
state
the
relation
of
a
particular
material
body
to
space-time
by
saying
that
it
is
just
there
in
that
place
and
so
far
as
simple
location
is
concerned
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
on
the
subject
there
are
however
some
subordinate
explanations
to
be
made
which
bring
in
the
minor
characteristics
which
i
have
already
mentioned
first
as
regards
time
if
material
has
existed
during
any
period
it
has
equally
been
in
existence
during
any
portion
of
that
period
in
other
words
dividing
the
time
does
not
divide
the
material
secondly
in
respect
to
space
dividing
the
volume
does
divide
the
material
accordingly
if
material
exists
throughout
a
volume
there
will
be
less
of
that
material
distributed
through
any
definite
half
of
that
volume
it
is
from
this
property
that
there
arises
our
notion
of
density
at
a
point
of
space
anyone
who
talks
about
density
is
not
assimilating
time
and
space
to
the
extent
that
some
extremists
of
the
modern
school
of
relativists
very
rashly
desire
for
the
division
of
time
functions
in
respect
to
material
quite
differently
from
the
division
of
space
furthermore
this
fact
that
the
material
is
indifferent
to
the
division
of
time
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
the
lapse
of
time
is
an
accident
rather
than
of
the
essence
of
the
material
the
material
is
fully
itself
in
any
sub-period
however
short
thus
the
transition
of
time
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
character
of
the
material
the
material
is
equally
itself
at
an
instant
of
time
here
an
instant
of
time
is
conceived
as
in
itself
without
transition
since
the
temporal
transition
is
the
succession
of
instants
the
answer
therefore
which
the
seventeenth
century
gave
to
the
ancient
question
of
the
ionian
thinkers
â€˜what
is
the
world
made
of?â€™
was
that
the
world
is
a
succession
of
instantaneous
configurations
of
matter,â€”or
of
material
if
you
wish
to
include
stuff
more
subtle
than
ordinary
matter
the
ether
for
example
we
cannot
wonder
that
science
rested
content
with
this
assumption
as
to
the
fundamental
elements
of
nature
the
great
forces
of
nature
such
as
gravitation
were
entirely
determined
by
the
configurations
of
masses
thus
the
configurations
determined
their
own
changes
so
that
the
circle
of
scientific
thought
was
completely
closed
this
is
the
famous
mechanistic
theory
of
nature
which
has
reigned
supreme
ever
since
the
seventeenth
century
it
is
the
orthodox
creed
of
physical
science
furthermore
the
creed
justified
itself
by
the
pragmatic
test
it
worked
physicists
took
no
more
interest
in
philosophy
they
emphasized
the
anti-rationalism
of
the
historical
revolt
but
the
difficulties
of
this
theory
of
materialistic
mechanism
very
soon
became
apparent
the
history
of
thought
in
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
is
governed
by
the
fact
that
the
world
had
got
hold
of
a
general
idea
which
it
could
neither
live
with
nor
live
without
this
simple
location
of
instantaneous
material
configurations
is
what
bergson
has
protested
against
so
far
as
it
concerns
time
and
so
far
as
it
is
taken
to
be
the
fundamental
fact
of
concrete
nature
he
calls
it
a
distortion
of
nature
due
to
the
intellectual
â€˜spatialisationâ€™
of
things
i
agree
with
bergson
in
his
protest:
but
i
do
not
agree
that
such
distortion
is
a
vice
necessary
to
the
intellectual
apprehension
of
nature
i
shall
in
subsequent
lectures
endeavour
to
show
that
this
spatialisation
is
the
expression
of
more
concrete
facts
under
the
guise
of
very
abstract
logical
constructions
there
is
an
error
but
it
is
merely
the
accidental
error
of
mistaking
the
abstract
for
the
concrete
it
is
an
example
of
what
i
will
call
the
â€˜fallacy
of
misplaced
concreteness.â€™
this
fallacy
is
the
occasion
of
great
confusion
in
philosophy
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
intellect
to
fall
into
the
trap
though
in
this
example
there
has
been
a
very
general
tendency
to
do
so
it
is
at
once
evident
that
the
concept
of
simple
location
is
going
to
make
great
difficulties
for
induction
for
if
in
the
location
of
configurations
of
matter
throughout
a
stretch
of
time
there
is
no
inherent
reference
to
any
other
times
past
or
future
it
immediately
follows
that
nature
within
any
period
does
not
refer
to
nature
at
any
other
period
accordingly
induction
is
not
based
on
anything
which
can
be
observed
as
inherent
in
nature
thus
we
cannot
look
to
nature
for
the
justification
of
our
belief
in
any
law
such
as
the
law
of
gravitation
in
other
words
the
order
of
nature
cannot
be
justified
by
the
mere
observation
of
nature
for
there
is
nothing
in
the
present
fact
which
inherently
refers
either
to
the
past
or
to
the
future
it
looks
therefore
as
though
memory
as
well
as
induction
would
fail
to
find
any
justification
within
nature
itself
i
have
been
anticipating
the
course
of
future
thought
and
have
been
repeating
humeâ€™s
argument
this
train
of
thought
follows
so
immediately
from
the
consideration
of
simple
location
that
we
cannot
wait
for
the
eighteenth
century
before
considering
it
the
only
wonder
is
that
the
world
did
in
fact
wait
for
hume
before
noting
the
difficulty
also
it
illustrates
the
anti-rationalism
of
the
scientific
public
that
when
hume
did
appear
it
was
only
the
religious
implications
of
his
philosophy
which
attracted
attention
this
was
because
the
clergy
were
in
principle
rationalists
whereas
the
men
of
science
were
content
with
a
simple
faith
in
the
order
of
nature
hume
himself
remarks
no
doubt
scoffingly
â€˜our
holy
religion
is
founded
on
faith.â€™
this
attitude
satisfied
the
royal
society
but
not
the
church
it
also
satisfied
hume
and
has
satisfied
subsequent
empiricists
there
is
another
presupposition
of
thought
which
must
be
put
beside
the
theory
of
simple
location
i
mean
the
two
correlative
categories
of
substance
and
quality
there
is
however
this
difference
there
were
different
theories
as
to
the
adequate
description
of
the
status
of
space
but
whatever
its
status
no
one
had
any
doubt
but
that
the
connection
with
space
enjoyed
by
entities
which
are
said
to
be
in
space
is
that
of
simple
location
we
may
put
this
shortly
by
saying
that
it
was
tacitly
assumed
that
space
is
the
locus
of
simple
locations
whatever
is
in
space
is
simpliciter
in
some
definite
portion
of
space
but
in
respect
to
substance
and
quality
the
leading
minds
of
the
seventeenth
century
were
definitely
perplexed
though
with
their
usual
genius
they
at
once
constructed
a
theory
which
was
adequate
for
their
immediate
purposes
of
course
substance
and
quality
as
well
as
simple
location
are
the
most
natural
ideas
for
the
human
mind
it
is
the
way
in
which
we
think
of
things
and
without
these
ways
of
thinking
we
could
not
get
our
ideas
straight
for
daily
use
there
is
no
doubt
about
this
the
only
question
is
how
concretely
are
we
thinking
when
we
consider
nature
under
these
conceptions?
my
point
will
be
that
we
are
presenting
ourselves
with
simplified
editions
of
immediate
matters
of
fact
when
we
examine
the
primary
elements
of
these
simplified
editions
we
shall
find
that
they
are
in
truth
only
to
be
justified
as
being
elaborate
logical
constructions
of
a
high
degree
of
abstraction
of
course
as
a
point
of
individual
psychology
we
get
at
the
ideas
by
the
rough
and
ready
method
of
suppressing
what
appear
to
be
irrelevant
details
but
when
we
attempt
to
justify
this
suppression
of
irrelevance
we
find
that
though
there
are
entities
left
corresponding
to
the
entities
we
talk
about
yet
these
entities
are
of
a
high
degree
of
abstraction
thus
i
hold
that
substance
and
quality
afford
another
instance
of
the
fallacy
of
misplaced
concreteness
let
us
consider
how
the
notions
of
substance
and
quality
arise
we
observe
an
object
as
an
entity
with
certain
characteristics
furthermore
each
individual
entity
is
apprehended
through
its
characteristics
for
example
we
observe
a
body
there
is
something
about
it
which
we
note
perhaps
it
is
hard
and
blue
and
round
and
noisy
we
observe
something
which
possesses
these
qualities:
apart
from
these
qualities
we
do
not
observe
anything
at
all
accordingly
the
entity
is
the
substratum
or
substance
of
which
we
predicate
qualities
some
of
the
qualities
are
essential
so
that
apart
from
them
the
entity
would
not
be
itself
while
other
qualities
are
accidental
and
changeable
in
respect
to
material
bodies
the
qualities
of
having
a
quantitative
mass
and
of
simple
location
somewhere
were
held
by
john
locke
at
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
to
be
essential
qualities
of
course
the
location
was
changeable
and
the
unchangeability
of
mass
was
merely
an
experimental
fact
except
for
some
extremists
so
far
so
good
but
when
we
pass
to
blueness
and
noisiness
a
new
situation
has
to
be
faced
in
the
first
place
the
body
may
not
be
always
blue
or
noisy
we
have
already
allowed
for
this
by
our
theory
of
accidental
qualities
which
for
the
moment
we
may
accept
as
adequate
but
in
the
second
place
the
seventeenth
century
exposed
a
real
difficulty
the
great
physicists
elaborated
transmission
theories
of
light
and
sound
based
upon
their
materialistic
views
of
nature
there
were
two
hypotheses
as
to
light:
either
it
was
transmitted
by
the
vibratory
waves
of
a
materialistic
ether
orâ€”according
to
newtonâ€”it
was
transmitted
by
the
motion
of
incredibly
small
corpuscles
of
some
subtle
matter
we
all
know
that
the
wave
theory
of
huyghens
held
the
field
during
the
nineteenth
century
and
that
at
present
physicists
are
endeavouring
to
explain
some
obscure
circumstances
attending
radiation
by
a
combination
of
both
theories
but
whatever
theory
you
choose
there
is
no
light
or
colour
as
a
fact
in
external
nature
there
is
merely
motion
of
material
again
when
the
light
enters
your
eyes
and
falls
on
the
retina
there
is
merely
motion
of
material
then
your
nerves
are
affected
and
your
brain
is
affected
and
again
this
is
merely
motion
of
material
the
same
line
of
argument
holds
for
sound
substituting
waves
in
the
air
for
waves
in
the
ether
and
ears
for
eyes
we
then
ask
in
what
sense
are
blueness
and
noisiness
qualities
of
the
body
by
analogous
reasoning
we
also
ask
in
what
sense
is
its
scent
a
quality
of
the
rose
galileo
considered
this
question
and
at
once
pointed
out
that
apart
from
eyes
ears
or
noses
there
would
be
no
colours
sounds
or
smells
descartes
and
locke
elaborated
a
theory
of
primary
and
secondary
qualities
for
example
descartes
in
his
â€˜sixth
meditationâ€™
says:[4
â€œand
indeed
as
i
perceive
different
sorts
of
colours
sounds
odours
tastes
heat
hardness
etc
i
safely
conclude
that
there
are
in
the
bodies
from
which
the
diverse
perceptions
of
the
senses
proceed
certain
varieties
corresponding
to
them
although
perhaps
not
in
reality
like
them;....â€
footnote
4:
translation
by
professor
john
veitch
also
in
his
principles
of
philosophy
he
says:
â€œthat
by
our
senses
we
know
nothing
of
external
objects
beyond
their
figure
or
situation
magnitude
and
motion.â€
locke
writing
with
a
knowledge
of
newtonian
dynamics
places
mass
among
the
primary
qualities
of
bodies
in
short
he
elaborates
a
theory
of
primary
and
secondary
qualities
in
accordance
with
the
state
of
physical
science
at
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
primary
qualities
are
the
essential
qualities
of
substances
whose
spatio-temporal
relationships
constitute
nature
the
orderliness
of
these
relationships
constitutes
nature
the
orderliness
of
these
relationships
constitutes
the
order
of
nature
the
occurrences
of
nature
are
in
some
way
apprehended
by
minds
which
are
associated
with
living
bodies
primarily
the
mental
apprehension
is
aroused
by
the
occurrences
in
certain
parts
of
the
correlated
body
the
occurrences
in
the
brain
for
instance
but
the
mind
in
apprehending
also
experiences
sensations
which
properly
speaking
are
qualities
of
the
mind
alone
these
sensations
are
projected
by
the
mind
so
as
to
clothe
appropriate
bodies
in
external
nature
thus
the
bodies
are
perceived
as
with
qualities
which
in
reality
do
not
belong
to
them
qualities
which
in
fact
are
purely
the
offspring
of
the
mind
thus
nature
gets
credit
which
should
in
truth
be
reserved
for
ourselves:
the
rose
for
its
scent:
the
nightingale
for
his
song:
and
the
sun
for
his
radiance
the
poets
are
entirely
mistaken
they
should
address
their
lyrics
to
themselves
and
should
turn
them
into
odes
of
self-congratulation
on
the
excellency
of
the
human
mind
nature
is
a
dull
affair
soundless
scentless
colourless
merely
the
hurrying
of
material
endlessly
meaninglessly
however
you
disguise
it
this
is
the
practical
outcome
of
the
characteristic
scientific
philosophy
which
closed
the
seventeenth
century
in
the
first
place
we
must
note
its
astounding
efficiency
as
a
system
of
concepts
for
the
organisation
of
scientific
research
in
this
respect
it
is
fully
worthy
of
the
genius
of
the
century
which
produced
it
it
has
held
its
own
as
the
guiding
principle
of
scientific
studies
ever
since
it
is
still
reigning
every
university
in
the
world
organises
itself
in
accordance
with
it
no
alternative
system
of
organising
the
pursuit
of
scientific
truth
has
been
suggested
it
is
not
only
reigning
but
it
is
without
a
rival
and
yetâ€”it
is
quite
unbelievable
this
conception
of
the
universe
is
surely
framed
in
terms
of
high
abstractions
and
the
paradox
only
arises
because
we
have
mistaken
our
abstractions
for
concrete
realities
no
picture
however
generalised
of
the
achievements
of
scientific
thought
in
this
century
can
omit
the
advance
in
mathematics
here
as
elsewhere
the
genius
of
the
epoch
made
itself
evident
three
great
frenchmen
descartes
desargues
pascal
initiated
the
modern
period
in
geometry
another
frenchman
fermat
laid
the
foundations
of
modern
analysis
and
all
but
perfected
the
methods
of
the
differential
calculus
newton
and
leibniz
between
them
actually
did
create
the
differential
calculus
as
a
practical
method
of
mathematical
reasoning
when
the
century
ended
mathematics
as
an
instrument
for
application
to
physical
problems
was
well
established
in
something
of
its
modern
proficiency
modern
pure
mathematics
if
we
except
geometry
was
in
its
infancy
and
had
given
no
signs
of
the
astonishing
growth
it
was
to
make
in
the
nineteenth
century
but
the
mathematical
physicist
had
appeared
bringing
with
him
the
type
of
mind
which
was
to
rule
the
scientific
world
in
the
next
century
it
was
to
be
the
age
of
â€˜victorious
analysis.â€™
the
seventeenth
century
had
finally
produced
a
scheme
of
scientific
thought
framed
by
mathematicians
for
the
use
of
mathematicians
the
great
characteristic
of
the
mathematical
mind
is
its
capacity
for
dealing
with
abstractions
and
for
eliciting
from
them
clear-cut
demonstrative
trains
of
reasoning
entirely
satisfactory
so
long
as
it
is
those
abstractions
which
you
want
to
think
about
the
enormous
success
of
the
scientific
abstractions
yielding
on
the
one
hand
matter
with
its
simple
location
in
space
and
time
and
on
the
other
hand
mind
perceiving
suffering
reasoning
but
not
interfering
has
foisted
onto
philosophy
the
task
of
accepting
them
as
the
most
concrete
rendering
of
fact
thereby
modern
philosophy
has
been
ruined
it
has
oscillated
in
a
complex
manner
between
three
extremes
there
are
the
dualists
who
accept
matter
and
mind
as
on
equal
basis
and
the
two
varieties
of
monists
those
who
put
mind
inside
matter
and
those
who
put
matter
inside
mind
but
this
juggling
with
abstractions
can
never
overcome
the
inherent
confusion
introduced
by
the
ascription
of
misplaced
concreteness
to
the
scientific
scheme
of
the
seventeenth
century
chapter
iv
the
eighteenth
century
in
so
far
as
the
intellectual
climates
of
different
epochs
can
be
contrasted
the
eighteenth
century
in
europe
was
the
complete
antithesis
to
the
middle
ages
the
contrast
is
symbolised
by
the
difference
between
the
cathedral
of
chartres
and
the
parisian
salons
where
dâ€™alembert
conversed
with
voltaire
the
middle
ages
were
haunted
with
the
desire
to
rationalise
the
infinite:
the
men
of
the
eighteenth
century
rationalised
the
social
life
of
modern
communities
and
based
their
sociological
theories
on
an
appeal
to
the
facts
of
nature
the
earlier
period
was
the
age
of
faith
based
upon
reason
in
the
later
period
they
let
sleeping
dogs
lie:
it
was
the
age
of
reason
based
upon
faith
to
illustrate
my
meaning:â€”st
anselm
would
have
been
distressed
if
he
had
failed
to
find
a
convincing
argument
for
the
existence
of
god
and
on
this
argument
he
based
his
edifice
of
faith
whereas
hume
based
his
dissertation
on
the
natural
history
of
religion
upon
his
faith
in
the
order
of
nature
in
comparing
these
epochs
it
is
well
to
remember
that
reason
can
err
and
that
faith
may
be
misplaced
in
my
previous
lecture
i
traced
the
evolution
during
the
seventeenth
century
of
the
scheme
of
scientific
ideas
which
has
dominated
thought
ever
since
it
involves
a
fundamental
duality
with
material
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
hand
mind
in
between
there
lie
the
concepts
of
life
organism
function
instantaneous
reality
interaction
order
of
nature
which
collectively
form
the
achilles
heel
of
the
whole
system
i
also
expressed
my
conviction
that
if
we
desired
to
obtain
a
more
fundamental
expression
of
the
concrete
character
of
natural
fact
the
element
in
this
scheme
which
we
should
first
criticise
is
the
concept
of
simple
location
in
view
therefore
of
the
importance
which
this
idea
will
assume
in
these
lectures
i
will
repeat
the
meaning
which
i
have
attached
to
this
phrase
to
say
that
a
bit
of
matter
has
simple
location
means
that
in
expressing
its
spatio-temporal
relations
it
is
adequate
to
state
that
it
is
where
it
is
in
a
definite
finite
region
of
space
and
throughout
a
definite
finite
duration
of
time
apart
from
any
essential
reference
of
the
relations
of
that
bit
of
matter
to
other
regions
of
space
and
to
other
durations
of
time
again
this
concept
of
simple
location
is
independent
of
the
controversy
between
the
absolutist
and
the
relativist
views
of
space
or
of
time
so
long
as
any
theory
of
space
or
of
time
can
give
a
meaning
either
absolute
or
relative
to
the
idea
of
a
definite
region
of
space
and
of
a
definite
duration
of
time
the
idea
of
simple
location
has
a
perfectly
definite
meaning
this
idea
is
the
very
foundation
of
the
seventeenth
century
scheme
of
nature
apart
from
it
the
scheme
is
incapable
of
expression
i
shall
argue
that
among
the
primary
elements
of
nature
as
apprehended
in
our
immediate
experience
there
is
no
element
whatever
which
possesses
this
character
of
simple
location
it
does
not
follow
however
that
the
science
of
the
seventeenth
century
was
simply
wrong
i
hold
that
by
a
process
of
constructive
abstraction
we
can
arrive
at
abstractions
which
are
the
simply-located
bits
of
material
and
at
other
abstractions
which
are
the
minds
included
in
the
scientific
scheme
accordingly
the
real
error
is
an
example
of
what
i
have
termed:
the
fallacy
of
misplaced
concreteness
the
advantage
of
confining
attention
to
a
definite
group
of
abstractions
is
that
you
confine
your
thoughts
to
clear-cut
definite
things
with
clear-cut
definite
relations
accordingly
if
you
have
a
logical
head
you
can
deduce
a
variety
of
conclusions
respecting
the
relationships
between
these
abstract
entities
furthermore
if
the
abstractions
are
well-founded
that
is
to
say
if
they
do
not
abstract
from
everything
that
is
important
in
experience
the
scientific
thought
which
confines
itself
to
these
abstractions
will
arrive
at
a
variety
of
important
truths
relating
to
our
experience
of
nature
we
all
know
those
clear-cut
trenchant
intellects
immovably
encased
in
a
hard
shell
of
abstractions
they
hold
you
to
their
abstractions
by
the
sheer
grip
of
personality
the
disadvantage
of
exclusive
attention
to
a
group
of
abstractions
however
well-founded
is
that
by
the
nature
of
the
case
you
have
abstracted
from
the
remainder
of
things
in
so
far
as
the
excluded
things
are
important
in
your
experience
your
modes
of
thought
are
not
fitted
to
deal
with
them
you
cannot
think
without
abstractions
accordingly
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
to
be
vigilant
in
critically
revising
your
modes
of
abstraction
it
is
here
that
philosophy
finds
its
niche
as
essential
to
the
healthy
progress
of
society
it
is
the
critic
of
abstractions
a
civilisation
which
cannot
burst
through
its
current
abstractions
is
doomed
to
sterility
after
a
very
limited
period
of
progress
an
active
school
of
philosophy
is
quite
as
important
for
the
locomotion
of
ideas
as
is
an
active
school
of
railway
engineers
for
the
locomotion
of
fuel
sometimes
it
happens
that
the
service
rendered
by
philosophy
is
entirely
obscured
by
the
astonishing
success
of
a
scheme
of
abstractions
in
expressing
the
dominant
interests
of
an
epoch
this
is
exactly
what
happened
during
the
eighteenth
century
les
philosophes
were
not
philosophers
they
were
men
of
genius
clear-headed
and
acute
who
applied
the
seventeenth
century
group
of
scientific
abstractions
to
the
analysis
of
the
unbounded
universe
their
triumph
in
respect
to
the
circle
of
ideas
mainly
interesting
to
their
contemporaries
was
overwhelming
whatever
did
not
fit
into
their
scheme
was
ignored
derided
disbelieved
their
hatred
of
gothic
architecture
symbolises
their
lack
of
sympathy
with
dim
perspectives
it
was
the
age
of
reason
healthy
manly
upstanding
reason
but
of
one-eyed
reason
deficient
in
its
vision
of
depth
we
cannot
overrate
the
debt
of
gratitude
which
we
owe
to
these
men
for
a
thousand
years
europe
had
been
a
prey
to
intolerant
intolerable
visionaries
the
common
sense
of
the
eighteenth
century
its
grasp
of
the
obvious
facts
of
human
suffering
and
of
the
obvious
demands
of
human
nature
acted
on
the
world
like
a
bath
of
moral
cleansing
voltaire
must
have
the
credit
that
he
hated
injustice
he
hated
cruelty
he
hated
senseless
repression
and
he
hated
hocus-pocus
furthermore
when
he
saw
them
he
knew
them
in
these
supreme
virtues
he
was
typical
of
his
century
on
its
better
side
but
if
men
cannot
live
on
bread
alone
still
less
can
they
do
so
on
disinfectants
the
age
had
its
limitations
yet
we
cannot
understand
the
passion
with
which
some
of
its
main
positions
are
still
defended
especially
in
the
schools
of
science
unless
we
do
full
justice
to
its
positive
achievements
the
seventeenth
century
scheme
of
concepts
was
proving
a
perfect
instrument
for
research
this
triumph
of
materialism
was
chiefly
in
the
sciences
of
rational
dynamics
physics
and
chemistry
so
far
as
dynamics
and
physics
were
concerned
progress
was
in
the
form
of
direct
developments
of
the
main
ideas
of
the
previous
epoch
nothing
fundamentally
new
was
introduced
but
there
was
an
immense
detailed
development
special
case
after
special
case
was
unravelled
it
was
as
though
the
very
heavens
were
being
opened
on
a
set
plan
in
the
second
half
of
the
century
lavoisier
practically
founded
chemistry
on
its
present
basis
he
introduced
into
it
the
principle
that
no
material
is
lost
or
gained
in
any
chemical
transformations
this
was
the
last
success
of
materialistic
thought
which
has
not
ultimately
proved
to
be
double-edged
chemical
science
now
only
waited
for
the
atomic
theory
in
the
next
century
in
this
century
the
notion
of
the
mechanical
explanation
of
all
the
processes
of
nature
finally
hardened
into
a
dogma
of
science
the
notion
won
through
on
its
merits
by
reason
of
an
almost
miraculous
series
of
triumphs
achieved
by
the
mathematical
physicists
culminating
in
the
mã©chanique
analytique
of
lagrange
which
was
published
in
1787
newtonâ€™s
principia
was
published
in
1687
so
that
exactly
one
hundred
years
separates
the
two
great
books
this
century
contains
the
first
period
of
mathematical
physics
of
the
modern
type
the
publication
of
clerk
maxwellâ€™s
electricity
and
magnetism
in
1873
marks
the
close
of
the
second
period
each
of
these
three
books
introduces
new
horizons
of
thought
affecting
everything
which
comes
after
them
in
considering
the
various
topics
to
which
mankind
has
bent
its
systematic
thought
it
is
impossible
not
to
be
struck
with
the
unequal
distribution
of
ability
among
the
different
fields
in
almost
all
subjects
there
are
a
few
outstanding
names
for
it
requires
genius
to
create
a
subject
as
a
distinct
topic
for
thought
but
in
the
case
of
many
topics
after
a
good
beginning
very
relevant
to
its
immediate
occasion
the
subsequent
development
appears
as
a
weak
series
of
flounderings
so
that
the
whole
subject
gradually
loses
its
grip
on
the
evolution
of
thought
it
was
far
otherwise
with
mathematical
physics
the
more
you
study
this
subject
the
more
you
will
find
yourself
astonished
by
the
almost
incredible
triumphs
of
intellect
which
it
exhibits
the
great
mathematical
physicists
of
the
eighteenth
and
first
few
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
most
of
them
french
are
a
case
in
point:
maupertuis
clairaut
dâ€™alembert
lagrange
laplace
fourier
form
a
series
of
names
such
that
each
recalls
to
mind
some
achievement
of
the
first
rank
when
carlyle
as
the
mouthpiece
of
the
subsequent
romantic
age
scoffingly
terms
the
period
the
age
of
victorious
analysis
and
mocks
at
maupertuis
as
a
â€˜sublimish
gentleman
in
a
white
periwig,â€™
he
only
exhibits
the
narrow
side
of
the
romanticists
whom
he
is
then
voicing
it
is
impossible
to
explain
intelligently
in
a
short
time
and
without
technicalities
the
details
of
the
progress
made
by
this
school
i
will
however
endeavour
to
explain
the
main
point
of
a
joint
achievement
of
maupertuis
and
lagrange
their
results
in
conjunction
with
some
subsequent
mathematical
methods
due
to
two
great
german
mathematicians
of
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
gauss
and
riemann
have
recently
proved
themselves
to
be
the
preparatory
work
necessary
for
the
new
ideas
which
herz
and
einstein
have
introduced
into
mathematical
physics
also
they
inspired
some
of
the
best
ideas
in
clerk
maxwellâ€™s
treatise
already
mentioned
in
this
lecture
they
aimed
at
discovering
something
more
fundamental
and
more
general
than
newtonâ€™s
laws
of
motion
which
were
discussed
in
the
previous
lecture
they
wanted
to
find
some
wider
ideas
and
in
the
case
of
lagrange
some
more
general
means
of
mathematical
exposition
it
was
an
ambitious
enterprise
and
they
were
completely
successful
maupertuis
lived
in
the
first
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
lagrangeâ€™s
active
life
lay
in
its
second
half
we
find
in
maupertuis
a
tinge
of
the
theologic
age
which
preceded
his
birth
he
started
with
the
idea
that
the
whole
path
of
a
material
particle
between
any
limits
of
time
must
achieve
some
perfection
worthy
of
the
providence
of
god
there
are
two
points
of
interest
in
this
motive
principle
in
the
first
place
it
illustrates
the
thesis
which
i
was
urging
in
my
first
lecture
that
the
way
in
which
the
medieval
church
had
impressed
on
europe
the
notion
of
the
detailed
providence
of
a
rational
personal
god
was
one
of
the
factors
by
which
the
trust
in
the
order
of
nature
had
been
generated
in
the
second
place
though
we
are
now
all
convinced
that
such
modes
of
thought
are
of
no
direct
use
in
detailed
scientific
enquiry
maupertuisâ€™
success
in
this
particular
case
shows
that
almost
any
idea
which
jogs
you
out
of
your
current
abstractions
may
be
better
than
nothing
in
the
present
case
what
the
idea
in
question
did
for
maupertuis
was
to
lead
him
to
enquire
what
general
property
of
the
path
as
a
whole
could
be
deduced
from
newtonâ€™s
laws
of
motion
undoubtedly
this
was
a
very
sensible
procedure
whatever
oneâ€™s
theological
notions
also
his
general
idea
led
him
to
conceive
that
the
property
found
would
be
a
quantitative
sum
such
that
any
slight
deviation
from
the
path
would
increase
it
in
this
supposition
he
was
generalising
newtonâ€™s
first
law
of
motion
for
an
isolated
particle
takes
the
shortest
route
with
uniform
velocity
so
maupertuis
conjectured
that
a
particle
travelling
through
a
field
of
force
would
realise
the
least
possible
amount
of
some
quantity
he
discovered
such
a
quantity
and
called
it
the
integral
action
between
the
time
limits
considered
in
modern
phraseology
it
is
the
sum
through
successive
small
lapses
of
time
of
the
difference
between
the
kinetic
and
potential
energies
of
the
particle
at
each
successive
instant
this
action
therefore
has
to
do
with
the
interchange
between
the
energy
arising
from
motion
and
the
energy
arising
from
position
maupertuis
had
discovered
the
famous
theorem
of
least
action
maupertuis
was
not
quite
of
the
first
rank
in
comparison
with
such
a
man
as
lagrange
in
his
hands
and
in
those
of
his
immediate
successors
his
principle
did
not
assume
any
dominating
importance
lagrange
put
the
same
question
on
a
wider
basis
so
as
to
make
its
answer
relevant
to
actual
procedure
in
the
development
of
dynamics
his
principle
of
virtual
work
as
applied
to
systems
in
motion
is
in
effect
maupertuisâ€™
principle
conceived
as
applying
at
each
instant
of
the
path
of
the
system
but
lagrange
saw
further
than
maupertuis
he
grasped
that
he
had
gained
a
method
of
stating
dynamical
truths
in
a
way
which
is
perfectly
indifferent
to
the
particular
methods
of
measurement
employed
in
fixing
the
positions
of
the
various
parts
of
the
system
accordingly
he
went
on
to
deduce
equations
of
motion
which
are
equally
applicable
whatever
quantitative
measurements
have
been
made
provided
that
they
are
adequate
to
fix
positions
the
beauty
and
almost
divine
simplicity
of
these
equations
is
such
that
these
formulae
are
worthy
to
rank
with
those
mysterious
symbols
which
in
ancient
times
were
held
directly
to
indicate
the
supreme
reason
at
the
base
of
all
things
later
herzâ€”inventor
of
electromagnetic
wavesâ€”based
mechanics
on
the
idea
of
every
particle
traversing
the
shortest
path
open
to
it
under
the
circumstances
constraining
its
motion
and
finally
einstein
by
the
use
of
the
geometrical
theories
of
gauss
and
riemann
showed
that
these
circumstances
could
be
construed
as
being
inherent
in
the
character
of
space-time
itself
such
in
barest
outline
is
the
story
of
dynamics
from
galileo
to
einstein
meanwhile
galvani
and
volta
lived
and
made
their
electric
discoveries
and
the
biological
sciences
slowly
gathered
their
material
but
still
waited
for
dominating
ideas
psychology
also
was
beginning
to
disengage
itself
from
its
dependence
on
general
philosophy
this
independent
growth
of
psychology
was
the
ultimate
result
of
its
invocation
by
john
locke
as
a
critic
of
metaphysical
licence
all
the
sciences
dealing
with
life
were
still
in
an
elementary
observational
stage
in
which
classification
and
direct
description
were
dominant
so
far
the
scheme
of
abstractions
was
adequate
to
the
occasion
in
the
realm
of
practice
the
age
which
produced
enlightened
rulers
such
as
the
emperor
joseph
of
the
house
of
hapsburg
frederick
the
great
walpole
the
great
lord
chatham
george
washington
cannot
be
said
to
have
failed
especially
when
to
these
rulers
it
adds
the
invention
of
parliamentary
cabinet
government
in
england
of
federal
presidential
government
in
the
united
states
and
of
the
humanitarian
principles
of
the
french
revolution
also
in
technology
it
produced
the
steam-engine
and
thereby
ushered
in
a
new
era
of
civilisation
undoubtedly
as
a
practical
age
the
eighteenth
century
was
a
success
if
you
had
asked
one
of
the
wisest
and
most
typical
of
its
ancestors
who
just
saw
its
commencement
i
mean
john
locke
what
he
expected
from
it
he
would
hardly
have
pitched
his
hopes
higher
than
its
actual
achievements
in
developing
a
criticism
of
the
scientific
scheme
of
the
eighteenth
century
i
must
first
give
my
main
reason
for
ignoring
nineteenth
century
idealismâ€”i
am
speaking
of
the
philosophic
idealism
which
finds
the
ultimate
meaning
of
reality
in
mentality
that
is
fully
cognitive
this
idealistic
school
as
hitherto
developed
has
been
too
much
divorced
from
the
scientific
outlook
it
has
swallowed
the
scientific
scheme
in
its
entirety
as
being
the
only
rendering
of
the
facts
of
nature
and
has
then
explained
it
as
being
an
idea
in
the
ultimate
mentality
in
the
case
of
absolute
idealism
the
world
of
nature
is
just
one
of
the
ideas
somehow
differentiating
the
unity
of
the
absolute:
in
the
case
of
pluralistic
idealism
involving
monadic
mentalities
this
world
is
the
greatest
common
measure
of
the
various
ideas
which
differentiate
the
various
mental
unities
of
the
various
monads
but
however
you
take
it
these
idealistic
schools
have
conspicuously
failed
to
connect
in
any
organic
fashion
the
fact
of
nature
with
their
idealistic
philosophies
so
far
as
concerns
what
will
be
said
in
these
lectures
your
ultimate
outlook
may
be
realistic
or
idealistic
my
point
is
that
a
further
stage
of
provisional
realism
is
required
in
which
the
scientific
scheme
is
recast
and
founded
upon
the
ultimate
concept
of
organism
in
outline
my
procedure
is
to
start
from
the
analysis
of
the
status
of
space
and
of
time
or
in
modern
phraseology
the
status
of
space-time
there
are
two
characters
of
either
things
are
separated
by
space
and
are
separated
by
time:
but
they
are
also
together
in
space
and
together
in
time
even
if
they
be
not
contemporaneous
i
will
call
these
characters
the
â€˜_separative_â€™
and
the
â€˜_prehensive_â€™
characters
of
space-time
there
is
yet
a
third
character
of
space-time
everything
which
is
in
space
receives
a
definite
limitation
of
some
sort
so
that
in
a
sense
it
has
just
that
shape
which
it
does
have
and
no
other
also
in
some
sense
it
is
just
in
this
place
and
in
no
other
analogously
for
time
a
thing
endures
during
a
certain
period
and
through
no
other
period
i
will
call
this
the
â€˜_modal_â€™
character
of
space-time
it
is
evident
that
the
modal
character
taken
by
itself
gives
rise
to
the
idea
of
simple
location
but
it
must
be
conjoined
with
the
separative
and
prehensive
characters
for
simplicity
of
thought
i
will
first
speak
of
space
only
and
will
afterwards
extend
the
same
treatment
to
time
the
volume
is
the
most
concrete
element
of
space
but
the
separative
character
of
space
analyses
a
volume
into
sub-volumes
and
so
on
indefinitely
accordingly
taking
the
separative
character
in
isolation
we
should
infer
that
a
volume
is
a
mere
multiplicity
of
non-voluminous
elements
of
points
in
fact
but
it
is
the
unity
of
volume
which
is
the
ultimate
fact
of
experience
for
example
the
voluminous
space
of
this
hall
this
hall
as
a
mere
multiplicity
of
points
is
a
construction
of
the
logical
imagination
accordingly
the
prime
fact
is
the
prehensive
unity
of
volume
and
this
unity
is
mitigated
or
limited
by
the
separated
unities
of
the
innumerable
contained
parts
we
have
a
prehensive
unity
which
is
yet
held
apart
as
an
aggregate
of
contained
parts
but
the
prehensive
unity
of
the
volume
is
not
the
unity
of
a
mere
logical
aggregate
of
parts
the
parts
form
an
ordered
aggregate
in
the
sense
that
each
part
is
something
from
the
standpoint
of
every
other
part
and
also
from
the
same
standpoint
every
other
part
is
something
in
relation
to
it
thus
if
a
and
b
and
c
are
volumes
of
space
b
has
an
aspect
from
the
standpoint
of
a
and
so
has
c
and
so
has
the
relationship
of
b
and
c
this
aspect
of
b
from
a
is
of
the
essence
of
a
the
volumes
of
space
have
no
independent
existence
they
are
only
entities
as
within
the
totality
you
cannot
extract
them
from
their
environment
without
destruction
of
their
very
essence
accordingly
i
will
say
that
the
aspect
of
b
from
a
is
the
mode
in
which
b
enters
into
the
composition
of
a
this
is
the
modal
character
of
space
that
the
prehensive
unity
of
a
is
the
prehension
into
unity
of
the
aspects
of
all
other
volumes
from
the
standpoint
of
a
the
shape
of
a
volume
is
the
formula
from
which
the
totality
of
its
aspects
can
be
derived
thus
the
shape
of
a
volume
is
more
abstract
than
its
aspects
it
is
evident
that
i
can
use
leibnizâ€™s
language
and
say
that
every
volume
mirrors
in
itself
every
other
volume
in
space
exactly
analogous
considerations
hold
with
respect
to
durations
in
time
an
instant
of
time
without
duration
is
an
imaginative
logical
construction
also
each
duration
of
time
mirrors
in
itself
all
temporal
durations
but
in
two
ways
i
have
introduced
a
false
simplicity
in
the
first
place
i
should
have
conjoined
space
and
time
and
conducted
my
explanation
in
respect
to
four-dimensional
regions
of
space-time
i
have
nothing
to
add
in
the
way
of
explanation
in
your
minds
substitute
such
four-dimensional
regions
for
the
spatial
volumes
of
the
previous
explanations
secondly
my
explanation
has
involved
itself
in
a
vicious
circle
for
i
have
made
the
prehensive
unity
of
the
region
a
to
consist
of
the
prehensive
unification
of
the
modal
presences
in
a
of
other
regions
this
difficulty
arises
because
space-time
cannot
in
reality
be
considered
as
a
self-subsistent
entity
it
is
an
abstraction
and
its
explanation
requires
reference
to
that
from
which
it
has
been
extracted
space-time
is
the
specification
of
certain
general
characters
of
events
and
of
their
mutual
ordering
this
recurrence
to
concrete
fact
brings
me
back
to
the
eighteenth
century
and
indeed
to
francis
bacon
in
the
seventeenth
century
we
have
to
consider
the
development
in
those
epochs
of
the
criticism
of
the
reigning
scientific
scheme
no
epoch
is
homogeneous
whatever
you
may
have
assigned
as
the
dominant
note
of
a
considerable
period
it
will
always
be
possible
to
produce
men
and
great
men
belonging
to
the
same
time
who
exhibit
themselves
as
antagonistic
to
the
tone
of
their
age
this
is
certainly
the
case
with
the
eighteenth
century
for
example
the
names
of
john
wesley
and
of
rousseau
must
have
occurred
to
you
while
i
was
drawing
the
character
of
that
time
but
i
do
not
want
to
speak
of
them
or
of
others
the
man
whose
ideas
i
must
consider
at
some
length
is
bishop
berkeley
quite
at
the
commencement
of
the
epoch
he
made
all
the
right
criticisms
at
least
in
principle
it
would
be
untrue
to
say
that
he
produced
no
effect
he
was
a
famous
man
the
wife
of
george
ii
was
one
of
the
few
queens
who
in
any
country
have
been
clever
enough
and
wise
enough
to
patronise
learning
judiciously
accordingly
berkeley
was
made
a
bishop
in
days
when
bishops
in
great
britain
were
relatively
far
greater
men
than
they
are
now
also
what
was
more
important
than
his
bishopric
hume
studied
him
and
developed
one
side
of
his
philosophy
in
a
way
which
might
have
disturbed
the
ghost
of
the
great
ecclesiastic
then
kant
studied
hume
so
to
say
that
berkeley
was
uninfluential
during
the
century
would
certainly
be
absurd
but
all
the
same
he
failed
to
affect
the
main
stream
of
scientific
thought
it
flowed
on
as
if
he
had
never
written
its
general
success
made
it
impervious
to
criticism
then
and
since
the
world
of
science
has
always
remained
perfectly
satisfied
with
its
peculiar
abstractions
they
work
and
that
is
sufficient
for
it
the
point
before
us
is
that
this
scientific
field
of
thought
is
now
in
the
twentieth
century
too
narrow
for
the
concrete
facts
which
are
before
it
for
analysis
this
is
true
even
in
physics
and
is
more
especially
urgent
in
the
biological
sciences
thus
in
order
to
understand
the
difficulties
of
modern
scientific
thought
and
also
its
reactions
on
the
modern
world
we
should
have
in
our
minds
some
conception
of
a
wider
field
of
abstraction
a
more
concrete
analysis
which
shall
stand
nearer
to
the
complete
concreteness
of
our
intuitive
experience
such
an
analysis
should
find
in
itself
a
niche
for
the
concepts
of
matter
and
spirit
as
abstractions
in
terms
of
which
much
of
our
physical
experience
can
be
interpreted
it
is
in
the
search
for
this
wider
basis
for
scientific
thought
that
berkeley
is
so
important
he
launched
his
criticism
shortly
after
the
schools
of
newton
and
locke
had
completed
their
work
and
laid
his
finger
exactly
on
the
weak
spots
which
they
had
left
i
do
not
propose
to
consider
either
the
subjective
idealism
which
has
been
derived
from
him
or
the
schools
of
development
which
trace
their
descent
from
hume
and
kant
respectively
my
point
will
be
thatâ€”whatever
the
final
metaphysics
you
may
adoptâ€”there
is
another
line
of
development
embedded
in
berkeley
pointing
to
the
analysis
which
we
are
in
search
of
berkeley
overlooked
it
partly
by
reason
of
the
over-intellectualism
of
philosophers
and
partly
by
his
haste
to
have
recourse
to
an
idealism
with
its
objectivity
grounded
in
the
mind
of
god
you
will
remember
that
i
have
already
stated
that
the
key
of
the
problem
lies
in
the
notion
of
simple
location
berkeley
in
effect
criticises
this
notion
he
also
raises
the
question
what
do
we
mean
by
things
being
realised
in
the
world
of
nature?
in
sections
23
and
24
of
his
principles
of
human
knowledge
berkeley
gives
his
answer
to
this
latter
question
i
will
quote
some
detached
sentences
from
those
sections:
â€œ23
but
say
you
surely
there
is
nothing
easier
than
for
me
to
imagine
trees
for
instance
in
a
park
or
books
existing
in
a
closet
and
nobody
by
to
perceive
them
i
answer
you
may
so
there
is
no
difficulty
in
it
but
what
is
all
this
i
beseech
you
more
than
framing
in
your
mind
certain
ideas
which
you
call
books
and
trees
and
at
the
same
time
omitting
to
frame
the
idea
of
any
one
that
may
perceive
them?...â€
â€œwhen
we
do
our
utmost
to
conceive
the
existence
of
external
bodies
we
are
all
the
while
only
contemplating
our
own
ideas
but
the
mind
taking
no
notice
of
itself
is
deluded
to
think
it
can
and
does
conceive
bodies
existing
unthought
of
or
without
the
mind
though
at
the
same
time
they
are
apprehended
by
or
exist
in
itself....â€
â€œ24
it
is
very
obvious
upon
the
least
inquiry
into
our
thoughts
to
know
whether
it
be
possible
for
us
to
understand
what
is
meant
by
the
absolute
existence
of
sensible
objects
in
themselves
or
without
the
mind
to
me
it
is
evident
those
words
mark
out
either
a
direct
contradiction
or
else
nothing
at
all....â€
again
there
is
a
very
remarkable
passage
in
section
10
of
the
fourth
dialogue
of
berkeleyâ€™s
alciphron
i
have
already
quoted
it
at
greater
length
in
my
principles
of
natural
knowledge_:
â€œ_euphranor
tell
me
alciphron
can
you
discern
the
doors
window
and
battlements
of
that
same
castle?
alciphron
i
cannot
at
this
distance
it
seems
only
a
small
round
tower
euph
but
i
who
have
been
at
it
know
that
it
is
no
small
round
tower
but
a
large
square
building
with
battlements
and
turrets
which
it
seems
you
do
not
see
alc
what
will
you
infer
from
thence?
euph
i
would
infer
that
the
very
object
which
you
strictly
and
properly
perceive
by
sight
is
not
that
thing
which
is
several
miles
distant
alc
why
so?
euph
because
a
little
round
object
is
one
thing
and
a
great
square
object
is
another
is
it
not
so?...â€
some
analogous
examples
concerning
a
planet
and
a
cloud
are
then
cited
in
the
dialogue
and
this
passage
finally
concludes
with:
â€œ_euphranor
is
it
not
plain
therefore
that
neither
the
castle
the
planet
nor
the
cloud
which
you
see
here
are
those
real
ones
which
you
suppose
exist
at
a
distance?â€
it
is
made
explicit
in
the
first
passage
already
quoted
that
berkeley
himself
adopts
an
extreme
idealistic
interpretation
for
him
mind
is
the
only
absolute
reality
and
the
unity
of
nature
is
the
unity
of
ideas
in
the
mind
of
god
personally
i
think
that
berkeleyâ€™s
solution
of
the
metaphysical
problem
raises
difficulties
not
less
than
those
which
he
points
out
as
arising
from
a
realistic
interpretation
of
the
scientific
scheme
there
is
however
another
possible
line
of
thought
which
enables
us
to
adopt
anyhow
an
attitude
of
provisional
realism
and
to
widen
the
scientific
scheme
in
a
way
which
is
useful
for
science
itself
i
recur
to
the
passage
from
francis
baconâ€™s
natural
history
already
quoted
in
the
previous
lecture:
â€œit
is
certain
that
all
bodies
whatsoever
though
they
have
no
sense
yet
they
have
perception:

and
whether
the
body
be
alterant
or
altered
evermore
a
perception
precedeth
operation
for
else
all
bodies
would
be
alike
one
to
another....â€
also
in
the
previous
lecture
i
construed
perception
as
used
by
bacon
as
meaning
taking
account
of
the
essential
character
of
the
thing
perceived
and
i
construed
sense
as
meaning
cognition
we
certainly
do
take
account
of
things
of
which
at
the
time
we
have
no
explicit
cognition
we
can
even
have
a
cognitive
memory
of
the
taking
account
without
having
had
a
contemporaneous
cognition
also
as
bacon
points
out
by
his
statement
â€œ
for
else
all
bodies
would
be
alike
one
to
another,â€
it
is
evidently
some
element
of
the
essential
character
which
we
take
account
of
namely
something
on
which
diversity
is
founded
and
not
mere
bare
logical
diversity
the
word
â€˜_perceive_â€™
is
in
our
common
usage
shot
through
and
through
with
the
notion
of
cognitive
apprehension
so
is
the
word
â€˜_apprehension_â€™
even
with
the
adjective
cognitive
omitted
i
will
use
the
word
â€˜_prehension_â€™
for
uncognitive
apprehension_:
by
this
i
mean
apprehension
which
may
or
or
may
not
be
cognitive
now
take
euphranorâ€™s
last
remark:
â€œis
it
not
plain
therefore
that
neither
the
castle
the
planet
nor
the
cloud
which
you
see
here
are
those
real
ones
which
you
suppose
exist
at
distance?â€
accordingly
there
is
a
prehension
here
in
this
place
of
things
which
have
a
reference
to
other
places
now
go
back
to
berkeleyâ€™s
sentences
quoted
from
his
principles
of
human
knowledge
he
contends
that
what
constitutes
the
realisation
of
natural
entities
is
the
being
perceived
within
the
unity
of
mind
we
can
substitute
the
concept
that
the
realisation
is
a
gathering
of
things
into
the
unity
of
a
prehension
and
that
what
is
thereby
realised
is
the
prehension
and
not
the
things
this
unity
of
a
prehension
defines
itself
as
a
here
and
a
now
and
the
things
so
gathered
into
the
grasped
unity
have
essential
reference
to
other
places
and
other
times
for
berkeleyâ€™s
mind
i
substitute
a
process
of
prehensive
unification
in
order
to
make
intelligible
this
concept
of
the
progressive
realisation
of
natural
occurrences
considerable
expansion
is
required
and
confrontation
with
its
actual
implications
in
terms
of
concrete
experience
this
will
be
the
task
of
the
subsequent
lectures
in
the
first
place
note
that
the
idea
of
simple
location
has
gone
the
things
which
are
grasped
into
a
realised
unity
here
and
now
are
not
the
castle
the
cloud
and
the
planet
simply
in
themselves
but
they
are
the
castle
the
cloud
and
the
planet
from
the
standpoint
in
space
and
time
of
the
prehensive
unification
in
other
words
it
is
the
perspective
of
the
castle
over
there
from
the
standpoint
of
the
unification
here
it
is
therefore
aspects
of
the
castle
the
cloud
and
the
planet
which
are
grasped
into
unity
here
you
will
remember
that
the
idea
of
perspectives
is
quite
familiar
in
philosophy
it
was
introduced
by
leibniz
in
the
notion
of
his
monads
mirroring
perspectives
of
the
universe
i
am
using
the
same
notion
only
i
am
toning
down
his
monads
into
the
unified
events
in
space
and
time
in
some
ways
there
is
a
greater
analogy
with
spinozaâ€™s
modes
that
is
why
i
use
the
terms
â€˜_mode_â€™
and
â€˜_modal_.â€™
in
the
analogy
with
spinoza
his
one
substance
is
for
me
the
one
underlying
activity
of
realisation
individualising
itself
in
an
interlocked
plurality
of
modes
thus
concrete
fact
is
process
its
primary
analysis
is
into
underlying
activity
of
prehension
and
into
realised
prehensive
events
each
event
is
an
individual
matter
of
fact
issuing
from
an
individualisation
of
the
substrate
activity
but
individualisation
does
not
mean
substantial
independence
an
entity
of
which
we
become
aware
in
sense
perception
is
the
terminus
of
our
act
of
perception
i
will
call
such
an
entity
a
â€˜_sense-object_â€™
for
example
green
of
a
definite
shade
is
a
sense-object
so
is
a
sound
of
definite
quality
and
pitch
and
so
is
a
definite
scent
and
a
definite
quality
of
touch
the
way
in
which
such
an
entity
is
related
to
space
during
a
definite
lapse
of
time
is
complex
i
will
say
that
a
sense-object
has
â€˜_ingression_â€™
into
space-time
the
cognitive
perception
of
a
sense-object
is
the
awareness
of
the
prehensive
unification
into
a
standpoint
a
of
various
modes
of
various
sense-objects
including
the
sense-object
in
question
the
standpoint
a
is
of
course
a
region
of
space-time
that
is
to
say
it
is
a
volume
of
space
through
a
duration
of
time
but
as
one
entity
this
standpoint
is
a
unit
of
realised
experience
a
mode
of
a
sense-object
at
a
as
abstracted
from
the
sense-object
whose
relationship
to
a
the
mode
is
conditioning
is
the
aspect
from
a
of
some
other
region
b
thus
the
sense-object
is
present
in
a
with
the
mode
of
location
in
b
thus
if
green
be
the
sense-object
in
question
green
is
not
simply
at
a
where
it
is
being
perceived
nor
is
it
simply
at
b
where
it
is
perceived
as
located
but
it
is
present
at
a
with
the
mode
of
location
in
b
there
is
no
particular
mystery
about
this
you
have
only
got
to
look
into
a
mirror
and
to
see
the
image
in
it
of
some
green
leaves
behind
your
back
for
you
at
a
there
will
be
green
but
not
green
simply
at
a
where
you
are
the
green
at
a
will
be
green
with
the
mode
of
having
location
at
the
image
of
the
leaf
behind
the
mirror
then
turn
round
and
look
at
the
leaf
you
are
now
perceiving
the
green
in
the
same
way
as
you
did
before
except
that
now
the
green
has
the
mode
of
being
located
in
the
actual
leaf
i
am
merely
describing
what
we
do
perceive:
we
are
aware
of
green
as
being
one
element
in
a
prehensive
unification
of
sense-objects
each
sense-object
and
among
them
green
having
its
particular
mode
which
is
expressible
as
location
elsewhere
there
are
various
types
of
modal
location
for
example
sound
is
voluminous:
it
fills
a
hall
and
so
sometimes
does
diffused
colour
but
the
modal
location
of
a
colour
may
be
that
of
being
the
remote
boundary
of
a
volume
as
for
example
the
colours
on
the
walls
of
a
room
thus
primarily
space-time
is
the
locus
of
the
modal
ingression
of
sense-objects
this
is
the
reason
why
space
and
time
if
for
simplicity
we
disjoin
them
are
given
in
their
entireties
for
each
volume
of
space
or
each
lapse
of
time
includes
in
its
essence
aspects
of
all
volumes
of
space
or
of
all
lapses
of
time
the
difficulties
of
philosophy
in
respect
to
space
and
time
are
founded
on
the
error
of
considering
them
as
primarily
the
loci
of
simple
locations
perception
is
simply
the
cognition
of
prehensive
unification
or
more
shortly
perception
is
cognition
of
prehension
the
actual
world
is
a
manifold
of
prehensions
and
a
â€˜prehensionâ€™
is
a
â€˜prehensive
occasionâ€™
and
a
prehensive
occasion
is
the
most
concrete
finite
entity
conceived
as
what
it
is
in
itself
and
for
itself
and
not
as
from
its
aspect
in
the
essence
of
another
such
occasion
prehensive
unification
might
be
said
to
have
simple
location
in
its
volume
a
but
this
would
be
a
mere
tautology
for
space
and
time
are
simply
abstractions
from
the
totality
of
prehensive
unifications
as
mutually
patterned
in
each
other
thus
a
prehension
has
simple
location
at
the
volume
a
in
the
same
way
as
that
in
which
a
manâ€™s
face
fits
on
to
the
smile
which
spreads
over
it
there
is
so
far
as
we
have
gone
more
sense
in
saying
that
an
act
of
perception
has
simple
location
for
it
may
be
conceived
as
being
simply
at
the
cognised
prehension
there
are
more
entities
involved
in
nature
than
the
mere
sense-objects
so
far
considered
but
allowing
for
the
necessity
of
revision
consequent
on
a
more
complete
point
of
view
we
can
frame
our
answer
to
berkeleyâ€™s
question
as
to
the
character
of
the
reality
to
be
assigned
to
nature
he
states
it
to
be
the
reality
of
ideas
in
mind
a
complete
metaphysic
which
has
attained
to
some
notion
of
mind
and
to
some
notion
of
ideas
may
perhaps
ultimately
adopt
that
view
it
is
unnecessary
for
the
purpose
of
these
lectures
to
ask
such
a
fundamental
question
we
can
be
content
with
a
provisional
realism
in
which
nature
is
conceived
as
a
complex
of
prehensive
unifications
space
and
time
exhibit
the
general
scheme
of
interlocked
relations
of
these
prehensions
you
cannot
tear
any
one
of
them
out
of
its
context
yet
each
one
of
them
within
its
context
has
all
the
reality
that
attaches
to
the
whole
complex
conversely
the
totality
has
the
same
reality
as
each
prehension
for
each
prehension
unifies
the
modalities
to
be
ascribed
from
its
standpoint
to
every
part
of
the
whole
a
prehension
is
a
process
of
unifying
accordingly
nature
is
a
process
of
expansive
development
necessarily
transitional
from
prehension
to
prehension
what
is
achieved
is
thereby
passed
beyond
but
it
is
also
retained
as
having
aspects
of
itself
present
to
prehensions
which
lie
beyond
it
thus
nature
is
a
structure
of
evolving
processes
the
reality
is
the
process
it
is
nonsense
to
ask
if
the
colour
red
is
real
the
colour
red
is
ingredient
in
the
process
of
realisation
the
realities
of
nature
are
the
prehensions
in
nature
that
is
to
say
the
events
in
nature
now
that
we
have
cleared
space
and
time
from
the
taint
of
simple
location
we
may
partially
abandon
the
awkward
term
prehension
this
term
was
introduced
to
signify
the
essential
unity
of
an
event
namely
the
event
as
one
entity
and
not
as
a
mere
assemblage
of
parts
or
of
ingredients
it
is
necessary
to
understand
that
space-time
is
nothing
else
than
a
system
of
pulling
together
of
assemblages
into
unities
but
the
word
event
just
means
one
of
these
spatio-temporal
unities
accordingly
it
may
be
used
instead
of
the
term
â€˜prehensionâ€™
as
meaning
the
thing
prehended
an
event
has
contemporaries
this
means
that
an
event
mirrors
within
itself
the
modes
of
its
contemporaries
as
a
display
of
immediate
achievement
an
event
has
a
past
this
means
that
an
event
mirrors
within
itself
the
modes
of
its
predecessors
as
memories
which
are
fused
into
its
own
content
an
event
has
a
future
this
means
that
an
event
mirrors
within
itself
such
aspects
as
the
future
throws
back
onto
the
present
or
in
other
words
as
the
present
has
determined
concerning
the
future
thus
an
event
has
anticipation:
â€œthe
prophetic
soul
of
the
wide
world
dreaming
on
things
to
come.â€
cvii
these
conclusions
are
essential
for
any
form
of
realism
for
there
is
in
the
world
for
our
cognisance
memory
of
the
past
immediacy
of
realisation
and
indication
of
things
to
come
in
this
sketch
of
an
analysis
more
concrete
than
that
of
the
scientific
scheme
of
thought
i
have
started
from
our
own
psychological
field
as
it
stands
for
our
cognition
i
take
it
for
what
it
claims
to
be:
the
self-knowledge
of
our
bodily
event
i
mean
the
total
event
and
not
the
inspection
of
the
details
of
the
body
this
self-knowledge
discloses
a
prehensive
unification
of
modal
presences
of
entities
beyond
itself
i
generalise
by
the
use
of
the
principle
that
this
total
bodily
event
is
on
the
same
level
as
all
other
events
except
for
an
unusual
complexity
and
stability
of
inherent
pattern
the
strength
of
the
theory
of
materialistic
mechanism
has
been
the
demand
that
no
arbitrary
breaks
be
introduced
into
nature
to
eke
out
the
collapse
of
an
explanation
i
accept
this
principle
but
if
you
start
from
the
immediate
facts
of
our
psychological
experience
as
surely
an
empiricist
should
begin
you
are
at
once
led
to
the
organic
conception
of
nature
of
which
the
description
has
been
commenced
in
this
lecture
it
is
the
defect
of
the
eighteenth
century
scientific
scheme
that
it
provides
none
of
the
elements
which
compose
the
immediate
psychological
experiences
of
mankind
nor
does
it
provide
any
elementary
trace
of
the
organic
unity
of
a
whole
from
which
the
organic
unities
of
electrons
protons
molecules
and
living
bodies
can
emerge
according
to
that
scheme
there
is
no
reason
in
the
nature
of
things
why
portions
of
material
should
have
any
physical
relations
to
each
other
let
us
grant
that
we
cannot
hope
to
be
able
to
discern
the
laws
of
nature
to
be
necessary
but
we
can
hope
to
see
that
it
is
necessary
that
there
should
be
an
order
of
nature
the
concept
of
the
order
of
nature
is
bound
up
with
the
concept
of
nature
as
the
locus
of
organisms
in
process
of
development
note
in
connection
with
the
latter
portion
of
this
chapter
a
sentence
from
descartesâ€™
â€˜reply
to
objections

against
the
meditationsâ€™
is
interesting:â€”â€œhence
the
idea
of
the
sun
will
be
the
sun
itself
existing
in
the
mind
not
indeed
formally
as
it
exists
in
the
sky
but
objectively
i.e
in
the
way
in
which
objects
are
wont
to
exist
in
the
mind
and
this
mode
of
being
is
truly
much
less
perfect
than
that
in
which
things
exist
outside
the
mind
but
it
is
not
on
that
account
mere
nothing
as
i
have
already
said.â€

my
last
lecture
described
the
influence
upon
the
eighteenth
century
of
the
narrow
and
efficient
scheme
of
scientific
concepts
which
it
had
inherited
from
its
predecessor
that
scheme
was
the
product
of
a
mentality
which
found
the
augustinian
theology
extremely
congenial
the
protestant
calvinism
and
the
catholic
jansenism
exhibited
man
as
helpless
to
co-operate
with
irresistible
grace:
the
contemporary
scheme
of
science
exhibited
man
as
helpless
to
co-operate
with
the
irresistable
mechanism
of
nature
the
mechanism
of
god
and
the
mechanism
of
matter
were
the
monstrous
issues
of
limited
metaphysics
and
clear
logical
intellect
also
the
seventeenth
century
had
genius
and
cleared
the
world
of
muddled
thought
the
eighteenth
century
continued
the
work
of
clearance
with
ruthless
efficiency
the
scientific
scheme
has
lasted
longer
than
the
theological
scheme
mankind
soon
lost
interest
in
irresistible
grace
but
it
quickly
appreciated
the
competent
engineering
which
was
due

science

quarter
of

eighteenth

george
berkeley
launched
his
philosophical
criticism
against
the
whole
basis
of
the
system
he
failed
to
disturb
the
dominant
current
of
thought
in
my
last
lecture
i
developed
a
parallel
line
of
argument
which
would
lead
to
a
system
of
thought
basing
nature
upon
the
concept
of
organism
and
not
upon
the
concept
of
matter
in
the
present
lecture
i
propose
in
the
first
place
to
consider
how
the
concrete
educated
thought
of
men
has
viewed
this
opposition
of
mechanism
and
organism
it
is
in
literature
that
the
concrete
outlook
of
humanity
receives
its
expression
accordingly
it
is
to
literature
that
we
must
look
particularly
in
its
more
concrete
forms
namely
in
poetry
and
in
drama
if
we
hope
to
discover
the
inward
thoughts
of
a
generation
we
quickly
find
that
the
western
peoples
exhibit
on
a
colossal
scale
a
peculiarity
which
is
popularly
supposed
to
be
more
especially
characteristic
of
the
chinese
surprise
is
often
expressed
that
a
chinaman
can
be
of
two
religions
a
confucian
for
some
occasions
and
a
buddhist
for
other
occasions
whether
this
is
true
of
china
i
do
not
know
nor
do
i
know
whether
if
true
these
two
attitudes
are
really
inconsistent
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
an
analogous
fact
is
true
of
the
west
and
that
the
two
attitudes
involved
are
inconsistent
a
scientific
realism
based
on
mechanism
is
conjoined
with
an
unwavering
belief
in
the
world
of
men
and
of
the
higher
animals
as
being
composed
of
self-determining
organisms
this
radical
inconsistency
at
the
basis
of
modern
thought
accounts
for
much
that
is
half-hearted
and
wavering
in
our
civilisation
it
would
be
going
too
far
to
say
that
it
distracts
thought
it
enfeebles
it
by
reason
of
the
inconsistency
lurking
in
the
background
after
all
the
men
of
the
middle
ages
were
in
pursuit
of
an
excellency
of
which
we
have
nearly
forgotten
the
existence
they
set
before
themselves
the
ideal
of
the
attainment
of
a
harmony
of
the
understanding
we
are
content
with
superficial
orderings
from
diverse
arbitrary
starting
points
for
instance
the
enterprises
produced
by
the
individualistic
energy
of
the
european
peoples
presupposes
physical
actions
directed
to
final
causes
but
the
science
which
is
employed
in
their
development
is
based
on
a
philosophy
which
asserts
that
physical
causation
is
supreme
and
which
disjoins
the
physical
cause
from
the
final
end
it
is
not
popular
to
dwell
on
the
absolute
contradiction
here
involved
it
is
the
fact
however
you
gloze
it
over
with
phrases
of
course
we
find
in
the
eighteenth
century
paleyâ€™s
famous
argument
that
mechanism
presupposes
a
god
who
is
the
author
of
nature
but
even
before
paley
put
the
argument
into
its
final
form
hume
had
written
the
retort
that
the
god
whom
you
will
find
will
be
the
sort
of
god
who
makes
that
mechanism
in
other
words
that
mechanism
can
at
most
presuppose
a
mechanic
and
not
merely
a
mechanic
but
its
mechanic
the
only
way
of
mitigating
mechanism
is
by
the
discovery
that
it
is
not
mechanism
when
we
leave
apologetic
theology
and
come
to
ordinary
literature
we
find
as
we
might
expect
that
the
scientific
outlook
is
in
general
simply
ignored
so
far
as
the
mass
of
literature
is
concerned
science
might
never
have
been
heard
of
until
recently
nearly
all
writers
have
been
soaked
in
classical
and
renaissance
literature
for
the
most
part
neither
philosophy
nor
science
interested
them
and
their
minds
were
trained
to
ignore
it
there
are
exceptions
to
this
sweeping
statement
and
even
if
we
confine
ourselves
to
english
literature
they
concern
some
of
the
greatest
names
also
the
indirect
influence
of
science
has
been
considerable
a
side
light
on
this
distracting
inconsistency
in
modern
thought
is
obtained
by
examining
some
of
those
great
serious
poems
in
english
literature
whose
general
scale
gives
them
a
didactic
character
the
relevant
poems
are
miltonâ€™s
paradise
lost
popeâ€™s
essay
on
man
wordsworthâ€™s
excursion
tennysonâ€™s
in
memoriam
milton
though
he
is
writing
after
the
restoration
voices
the
theological
aspect
of
the
earlier
portion
of
his
century
untouched
by
the
influence
of
the
scientific
materialism
popeâ€™s
poem
represents
the
effect
on
popular
thought
of
the
intervening
sixty
years
which
includes
the
first
period
of
assured
triumph
for
the
scientific
movement
wordsworth
in
his
whole
being
expresses
a
conscious
reaction
against
the
mentality
of
the
eighteenth
century
this
mentality
means
nothing
else
than
the
acceptance
of
the
scientific
ideas
at
their
full
face
value
wordsworth
was
not
bothered
by
any
intellectual
antagonism
what
moved
him
was
a
moral
repulsion
he
felt
that
something
had
been
left
out
and
that
what
had
been
left
out
comprised
everything
that
was
most
important
tennyson
is
the
mouthpiece
of
the
attempts
of
the
waning
romantic
movement
in
the
second
quarter
of
the
nineteenth
century
to
come
to
terms
with
science
by
this
time
the
two
elements
in
modern
thought
had
disclosed
their
fundamental
divergence
by
their
jarring
interpretations
of
the
course
of
nature
and
the
life
of
man
tennyson
stands
in
this
poem
as
the
perfect
example
of
the
distraction
which
i
have
already
mentioned
there
are
opposing
visions
of
the
world
and
both
of
them
command
his
assent
by
appeals
to
ultimate
intuitions
from
which
there
seems
no
escape
tennyson
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
difficulty
it
is
the
problem
of
mechanism
which
appalls
him
â€œâ€˜the
stars,â€™
she
whispers
â€˜blindly
run.â€™â€
this
line
states
starkly
the
whole
philosophic
problem
implicit
in
the
poem
each
molecule
blindly
runs
the
human
body
is
a
collection
of
molecules
therefore
the
human
body
blindly
runs
and
therefore
there
can
be
no
individual
responsibility
for
the
actions
of
the
body
if
you
once
accept
that
the
molecule
is
definitely
determined
to
be
what
it
is
independently
of
any
determination
by
reason
of
the
total
organism
of
the
body
and
if
you
further
admit
that
the
blind
run
is
settled
by
the
general
mechanical
laws
there
can
be
no
escape
from
this
conclusion
but
mental
experiences
are
derivative
from
the
actions
of
the
body
including
of
course
its
internal
behaviour
accordingly
the
sole
function
of
the
mind
is
to
have
at
least
some
of
its
experiences
settled
for
it
and
to
add
such
others
as
may
be
open
to
it
independently
of
the
bodyâ€™s
motions
internal
and
external
there
are
then
two
possible
theories
as
to
the
mind
you
can
either
deny
that
it
can
supply
for
itself
any
experiences
other
than
those
provided
for
it
by
the
body
or
you
can
admit
them
if
you
refuse
to
admit
the
additional
experiences
then
all
individual
moral
responsibility
is
swept
away
if
you
do
admit
them
then
a
human
being
may
be
responsible
for
the
state
of
his
mind
though
he
has
no
responsibility
for
the
actions
of
his
body
the
enfeeblement
of
thought
in
the
modern
world
is
illustrated
by
the
way
in
which
this
plain
issue
is
avoided
in
tennysonâ€™s
poem
there
is
something
kept
in
the
background
a
skeleton
in
the
cupboard
he
touches
on
almost
every
religious
and
scientific
problem
but
carefully
avoids
more
than
a
passing
allusion
to
this
one
this
very
problem
was
in
full
debate
at
the
date
of
the
poem
john
stuart
mill
was
maintaining
his
doctrine
of
determinism
in
this
doctrine
volitions
are
determined
by
motives
and
motives
are
expressible
in
terms
of
antecedent
conditions
including
states
of
mind
as
well
as
states
of
the
body
it
is
obvious
that
this
doctrine
affords
no
escape
from
the
dilemma
presented
by
a
thoroughgoing
mechanism
for
if
the
volition
affects
the
state
of
the
body
then
the
molecules
in
the
body
do
not
blindly
run
if
the
volition
does
not
affect
the
state
of
the
body
the
mind
is
still
left
in
its
uncomfortable
position
millâ€™s
doctrine
is
generally
accepted
especially
among
scientists
as
though
in
some
way
it
allowed
you
to
accept
the
extreme
doctrine
of
materialistic
mechanism
and
yet
mitigated
its
unbelievable
consequences
it
does
nothing
of
the
sort
either
the
bodily
molecules
blindly
run
or
they
do
not
if
they
do
blindly
run
the
mental
states
are
irrelevant
in
discussing
the
bodily
actions
i
have
stated
the
arguments
concisely
because
in
truth
the
issue
is
a
very
simple
one
prolonged
discussion
is
merely
a
source
of
confusion
the
question
as
to
the
metaphysical
status
of
molecules
does
not
come
in
the
statement
that
they
are
mere
formulae
has
no
bearing
on
the
argument
for
presumably
the
formulae
mean
something
if
they
mean
nothing
the
whole
mechanical
doctrine
is
likewise
without
meaning
and
the
question
drops
but
if
the
formulae
mean
anything
the
argument
applies
to
exactly
what
they
do
mean
the
traditional
way
of
evading
the
difficultyâ€”other
than
the
simple
way
of
ignoring
itâ€”is
to
have
recourse
to
some
form
of
what
is
now
termed
â€˜vitalism.â€™
this
doctrine
is
really
a
compromise
it
allows
a
free
run
to
mechanism
throughout
the
whole
of
inanimate
nature
and
holds
that
the
mechanism
is
partially
mitigated
within
living
bodies
i
feel
that
this
theory
is
an
unsatisfactory
compromise
the
gap
between
living
and
dead
matter
is
too
vague
and
problematical
to
bear
the
weight
of
such
an
arbitrary
assumption
which
involves
an
essential
dualism
somewhere
the
doctrine
which
i
am
maintaining
is
that
the
whole
concept
of
materialism
only
applies
to
very
abstract
entities
the
products
of
logical
discernment
the
concrete
enduring
entities
are
organisms
so
that
the
plan
of
the
whole
influences
the
very
characters
of
the
various
subordinate
organisms
which
enter
into
it
in
the
case
of
an
animal
the
mental
states
enter
into
the
plan
of
the
total
organism
and
thus
modify
the
plans
of
the
successive
subordinate
organisms
until
the
ultimate
smallest
organisms
such
as
electrons
are
reached
thus
an
electron
within
a
living
body
is
different
from
an
electron
outside
it
by
reason
of
the
plan
of
the
body
the
electron
blindly
runs
either
within
or
without
the
body
but
it
runs
within
the
body
in
accordance
with
its
character
within
the
body
that
is
to
say
in
accordance
with
the
general
plan
of
the
body
and
this
plan
includes
the
mental
state
but
this
principle
of
modification
is
perfectly
general
throughout
nature
and
represents
no
property
peculiar
to
living
bodies
in
subsequent
lectures
it
will
be
explained
that
this
doctrine
involves
the
abandonment
of
the
traditional
scientific
materialism
and
the
substitution
of
an
alternative
doctrine
of
organism
i
shall
not
discuss
millâ€™s
determinism
as
it
lies
outside
the
scheme
of
these
lectures
the
foregoing
discussion
has
been
directed
to
secure
that
either
determinism
or
free
will
shall
have
some
relevance
unhampered
by
the
difficulties
introduced
by
materialistic
mechanism
or
by
the
compromise
of
vitalism
i
would
term
the
doctrine
of
these
lectures
the
theory
of
organic
mechanism
in
this
theory
the
molecules
may
blindly
run
in
accordance
with
the
general
laws
but
the
molecules
differ
in
their
intrinsic
characters
according
to
the
general
organic
plans
of
the
situations
in
which
they
find
themselves
the
discrepancy
between
the
materialistic
mechanism
of
science
and
the
moral
intuitions
which
are
presupposed
in
the
concrete
affairs
of
life
only
gradually
assumed
its
true
importance
as
the
centuries
advanced
the
different
tones
of
the
successive
epochs
to
which
the
poems
already
mentioned
belong
are
curiously
reflected
in
their
opening
passages
milton
ends
his
introduction
with
the
prayer
â€œthat
to
the
height
of
this
great
argument
i
may
assert
eternal
providence
and
justify
the
ways
of
god
to
men.â€
to
judge
from
many
modern
writers
on
milton
we
might
imagine
that
the
paradise
lost
and
the
paradise
regained
were
written
as
a
series
of
experiments
in
blank
verse
this
was
certainly
not
miltonâ€™s
view
of
his
work
to
â€˜justify
the
ways
of
god
to
menâ€™
was
very
much
his
main
object
he
recurs
to
the
same
idea
in
the
samson
agonistes
â€œjust
are
the
ways
of
god
and
justifiable
to
men;â€
we
note
the
assured
volume
of
confidence
untroubled
by
the
coming
scientific
avalanche
the
actual
date
of
the
publication
of
the
paradise
lost
lies
just
beyond
the
epoch
to
which
it
belongs
it
is
the
swansong
of
a
passing
world
of
untroubled
certitude
a
comparison
between
popeâ€™s
essay
on
man
and
the
paradise
lost
exhibits
the
change
of
tone
in
english
thought
in
the
fifty
or
sixty
years
which
separate
the
age
of
milton
from
the
age
of
pope
milton
addresses
his
poem
to
god
popeâ€™s
poem
is
addressed
to
lord
bolingbroke
â€œawake
my
st
john
leave
all
meaner
things
to
low
ambition
and
the
pride
of
kings
let
us
since
life
can
little
more
supply
than
just
to
look
about
us
and
to
die
expatiate
free
oâ€™er
all
this
scene
of
man
a
mighty
maze
but
not
without
a
plan;â€
compare
the
jaunty
assurance
of
pope
â€œa
mighty
maze
but
not
without
a
plan.â€
with
miltonâ€™s
â€œjust
are
the
ways
of
god
and
justifiable
to
men;â€
but
the
real
point
to
notice
is
that
pope
as
well
as
milton
was
untroubled
by
the
great
perplexity
which
haunts
the
modern
world
the
clue
which
milton
followed
was
to
dwell
on
the
ways
of
god
in
dealings
with
man
two
generations
later
we
find
pope
equally
confident
that
the
enlightened
methods
of
modern
science
provided
a
plan
adequate
as
a
map
of
the
â€˜mighty
maze.â€™
wordsworthâ€™s
excursion
is
the
next
english
poem
on
the
same
subject
a
prose
preface
tells
us
that
it
is
a
fragment
of
a
larger
projected
work
described
as
â€˜a
philosophical
poem
containing
views
of
man
nature
and
society.â€™
very
characteristically
the
poem
begins
with
the
line
â€œâ€™twas
summer
and
the
sun
had
mounted
high:â€
thus
the
romantic
reaction
started
neither
with
god
nor
with
lord
bolingbroke
but
with
nature
we
are
here
witnessing
a
conscious
reaction
against
the
whole
tone
of
the
eighteenth
century
that
century
approached
nature
with
the
abstract
analysis
of
science
whereas
wordsworth
opposes
to
the
scientific
abstractions
his
full
concrete
experience
a
generation
of
religious
revival
and
of
scientific
advance
lies
between
the
excursion
and
tennysonâ€™s
in
memoriam
the
earlier
poets
had
solved
the
perplexity
by
ignoring
it
that
course
was
not
open
to
tennyson
accordingly
his
poem
begins
thus:
â€œstrong
son
of
god
immortal
love
whom
we
that
have
not
seen
thy
face
by
faith
and
faith
alone
embrace
believing
where
we
cannot
prove;â€
the
note
of
perplexity
is
struck
at
once
the
nineteenth
century
has
been
a
perplexed
century
in
a
sense
which
is
not
true
of
any
of
its
predecessors
of
the
modern
period
in
the
earlier
times
there
were
opposing
camps
bitterly
at
variance
on
questions
which
they
deemed
fundamental
but
except
for
a
few
stragglers
either
camp
was
whole-hearted
the
importance
of
tennysonâ€™s
poem
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
exactly
expressed
the
character
of
its
period
each
individual
was
divided
against
himself
in
the
earlier
times
the
deep
thinkers
were
the
clear
thinkers,â€”descartes
spinoza
locke
leibniz
they
knew
exactly
what
they
meant
and
said
it
in
the
nineteenth
century
some
of
the
deeper
thinkers
among
theologians
and
philosophers
were
muddled
thinkers
their
assent
was
claimed
by
incompatible
doctrines
and
their
efforts
at
reconciliation
produced
inevitable
confusion
matthew
arnold
even
more
than
tennyson
was
the
poet
who
expressed
this
mood
of
individual
distraction
which
was
so
characteristic
of
this
century
compare
with
in
memoriam
the
closing
lines
of
arnoldâ€™s
dover
beach_:
â€œand
we
are
here
as
on
a
darkling
plain
swept
with
confused
alarms
of
struggle
and
flight
where
ignorant
armies
clash
by
night.â€
cardinal
newman
in
his
apologia
pro
vitã¢
suã¢
mentions
it
as
a
peculiarity
of
pusey
the
great
anglican
ecclesiastic
â€œhe
was
haunted
by
no
intellectual
perplexities.â€
in
this
respect
pusey
recalls
milton
pope
wordsworth
as
in
contrast
with
tennyson
clough
matthew
arnold
and
newman
himself
so
far
as
concerns
english
literature
we
find
as
might
be
anticipated
the
most
interesting
criticism
of
the
thoughts
of
science
among
the
leaders
of
the
romantic
reaction
which
accompanied
and
succeeded
the
epoch
of
the
french
revolution
in
english
literature
the
deepest
thinkers
of
this
school
were
coleridge
wordsworth
and
shelley
keats
is
an
example
of
literature
untouched
by
science
we
may
neglect
coleridgeâ€™s
attempt
at
an
explicit
philosophical
formulation
it
was
influential
in
his
own
generation
but
in
these
lectures
it
is
my
object
only
to
mention
those
elements
of
the
thought
of
the
past
which
stand
for
all
time
even
with
this
limitation
only
a
selection
is
possible
for
our
purposes
coleridge
is
only
important
by
his
influence
on
wordsworth
thus
wordsworth
and
shelley
remain
wordsworth
was
passionately
absorbed
in
nature
it
has
been
said
of
spinoza
that
he
was
drunk
with
god
it
is
equally
true
that
wordsworth
was
drunk
with
nature
but
he
was
a
thoughtful
well-read
man
with
philosophical
interests
and
sane
even
to
the
point
of
prosiness
in
addition
he
was
a
genius
he
weakens
his
evidence
by
his
dislike
of
science
we
all
remember
his
scorn
of
the
poor
man
whom
he
somewhat
hastily
accuses
of
peeping
and
botanising
on
his
motherâ€™s
grave
passage
after
passage
could
be
quoted
from
him
expressing
this
repulsion
in
this
respect
his
characteristic
thought
can
be
summed
up
in
his
phrase
â€˜we
murder
to
dissect.â€™
in
this
latter
passage
he
discloses
the
intellectual
basis
of
his
criticism
of
science
he
alleges
against
science
its
absorption
in
abstractions
his
consistent
theme
is
that
the
important
facts
of
nature
elude
the
scientific
method
it
is
important
therefore
to
ask
what
wordsworth
found
in
nature
that
failed
to
receive
expression
in
science
i
ask
this
question
in
the
interest
of
science
itself
for
one
main
position
in
these
lectures
is
a
protest
against
the
idea
that
the
abstractions
of
science
are
irreformable
and
unalterable
now
it
is
emphatically
not
the
case
that
wordsworth
hands
over
inorganic
matter
to
the
mercy
of
science
and
concentrates
on
the
faith
that
in
the
living
organism
there
is
some
element
that
science
cannot
analyse
of
course
he
recognises
what
no
one
doubts
that
in
some
sense
living
things
are
different
from
lifeless
things
but
that
is
not
his
main
point
it
is
the
brooding
presence
of
the
hills
which
haunts
him
his
theme
is
nature
in
solido
that
is
to
say
he
dwells
on
that
mysterious
presence
of
surrounding
things
which
imposes
itself
on
any
separate
element
that
we
set
up
as
an
individual
for
its
own
sake
he
always
grasps
the
whole
of
nature
as
involved
in
the
tonality
of
the
particular
instance
that
is
why
he
laughs
with
the
daffodils
and
finds
in
the
primrose
â€œthoughts
too
deep
for
terms.â€
wordsworthâ€™s
greatest
poem
is
by
far
the
first
book
of
the
prelude
it
is
pervaded
by
this
sense
of
the
haunting
presences
of
nature
a
series
of
magnificent
passages
too
long
for
quotation
express
this
idea
of
course
wordsworth
is
a
poet
writing
a
poem
and
is
not
concerned
with
dry
philosophical
statements
but
it
would
hardly
be
possible
to
express
more
clearly
a
feeling
for
nature
as
exhibiting
entwined
prehensive
unities
each
suffused
with
modal
presences
of
others:
â€œye
presences
of
nature
in
the
sky
and
on
the
earth
ye
visions
of
the
hills
and
souls
of
lonely
places
can
i
think
a
vulgar
hope
was
yours
when
ye
employed
such
ministry
when
ye
through
many
a
year
haunting
me
thus
among
my
boyish
sports
on
caves
and
trees
upon
the
woods
and
hills
impressed
upon
all
forms
the
characters
of
danger
or
desire
and
thus
did
make
the
surface
of
the
universal
earth
with
triumph
and
delight
with
hope
and
fear
work
like
a
sea?...â€
in
thus
citing
wordsworth
the
point
which
i
wish
to
make
is
that
we
forget
how
strained
and
paradoxical
is
the
view
of
nature
which
modern
science
imposes
on
our
thoughts
wordsworth
to
the
height
of
genius
expresses
the
concrete
facts
of
our
apprehension
facts
which
are
distorted
in
the
scientific
analysis
is
it
not
possible
that
the
standardised
concepts
of
science
are
only
valid
within
narrow
limitations
perhaps
too
narrow
for
science
itself?
shelleyâ€™s
attitude
to
science
was
at
the
opposite
pole
to
that
of
wordsworth
he
loved
it
and
is
never
tired
of
expressing
in
poetry
the
thoughts
which
it
suggests
it
symbolises
to
him
joy
and
peace
and
illumination
what
the
hills
were
to
the
youth
of
wordsworth
a
chemical
laboratory
was
to
shelley
it
is
unfortunate
that
shelleyâ€™s
literary
critics
have
in
this
respect
so
little
of
shelley
in
their
own
mentality
they
tend
to
treat
as
a
casual
oddity
of
shelleyâ€™s
nature
what
was
in
fact
part
of
the
main
structure
of
his
mind
permeating
his
poetry
through
and
through
if
shelley
had
been
born
a
hundred
years
later
the
twentieth
century
would
have
seen
a
newton
among
chemists
for
the
sake
of
estimating
the
value
of
shelleyâ€™s
evidence
it
is
important
to
realise
this
absorption
of
his
mind
in
scientific
ideas
it
can
be
illustrated
by
lyric
after
lyric
i
will
choose
one
poem
only
the
fourth
act
of
his
prometheus
unbound
the
earth
and
the
moon
converse
together
in
the
language
of
accurate
science
physical
experiments
guide
his
imagery
for
example
the
earthâ€™s
exclamation
â€œthe
vaporous
exultation
not
to
be
confined!â€
is
the
poetic
transcript
of
â€˜the
expansive
force
of
gases,â€™
as
it
is
termed
in
books
on
science
again
take
the
earthâ€™s
stanza
â€œi
spin
beneath
my
pyramid
of
night
which
points
into
the
heavens,â€”dreaming
delight
murmuring
victorious
joy
in
my
enchanted
sleep
as
a
youth
lulled
in
love-dreams
faintly
sighing
under
the
shadow
of
his
beauty
lying
which
round
his
rest
a
watch
of
light
and
warmth
doth
keep.â€
this
stanza
could
only
have
been
written
by
someone
with
a
definite
geometrical
diagram
before
his
inward
eyeâ€”a
diagram
which
it
has
often
been
my
business
to
demonstrate
to
mathematical
classes
as
evidence
note
especially
the
last
line
which
gives
poetical
imagery
to
the
light
surrounding
nightâ€™s
pyramid
this
idea
could
not
occur
to
anyone
without
the
diagram
but
the
whole
poem
and
other
poems
are
permeated
with
touches
of
this
kind
now
the
poet
so
sympathetic
with
science
so
absorbed
in
its
ideas
can
simply
make
nothing
of
the
doctrine
of
secondary
qualities
which
is
fundamental
to
its
concepts
for
shelley
nature
retains
its
beauty
and
its
colour
shelleyâ€™s
nature
is
in
its
essence
a
nature
of
organisms
functioning
with
the
full
content
of
our
perceptual
experience
we
are
so
used
to
ignoring
the
implications
of
orthodox
scientific
doctrine
that
it
is
difficult
to
make
evident
the
criticism
upon
it
which
is
thereby
implied
if
anybody
could
have
treated
it
seriously
shelley
would
have
done
so
furthermore
shelley
is
entirely
at
one
with
wordsworth
as
to
the
interfusing
of
the
presence
in
nature
here
is
the
opening
stanza
of
his
poem
entitled
mont
blanc_:
â€œthe
everlasting
universe
of
things
flows
through
the
mind
and
rolls
its
rapid
waves
now
darkâ€”now
glitteringâ€”now
reflecting
gloomâ€”
now
lending
splendour
where
from
secret
springs
the
source
of
human
thought
its
tribute
brings
of
waters,â€”with
a
sound
but
half
its
own
such
as
a
feeble
brook
will
oft
assume
in
the
wild
woods
among
the
mountains
lone
where
waterfalls
around
it
leap
for
ever
where
woods
and
winds
contend
and
a
vast
river
over
its
rocks
ceaselessly
bursts
and
raves.â€
shelley
has
written
these
lines
with
explicit
reference
to
some
form
of
idealism
kantian
or
berkeleyan
or
platonic
but
however
you
construe
him
he
is
here
an
emphatic
witness
to
a
prehensive
unification
as
constituting
the
very
being
of
nature
berkeley
wordsworth
shelley
are
representative
of
the
intuitive
refusal
seriously
to
accept
the
abstract
materialism
of
science
there
is
an
interesting
difference
in
the
treatment
of
nature
by
wordsworth
and
by
shelley
which
brings
forward
the
exact
questions
we
have
got
to
think
about
shelley
thinks
of
nature
as
changing
dissolving
transforming
as
it
were
at
a
fairyâ€™s
touch
the
leaves
fly
before
the
west
wind
â€œlike
ghosts
from
an
enchanter
fleeing.â€
in
his
poem
the
cloud
it
is
the
transformations
of
water
which
excite
his
imagination
the
subject
of
the
poem
is
the
endless
eternal
elusive
change
of
things:
â€œi
change
but
i
cannot
die.â€
this
is
one
aspect
of
nature
its
elusive
change:
a
change
not
merely
to
be
expressed
by
locomotion
but
a
change
of
inward
character
this
is
where
shelley
places
his
emphasis
on
the
change
of
what
cannot
die
wordsworth
was
born
among
hills
hills
mostly
barren
of
trees
and
thus
showing
the
minimum
of
change
with
the
seasons
he
was
haunted
by
the
enormous
permanences
of
nature
for
him
change
is
an
incident
which
shoots
across
a
background
of
endurance
â€œbreaking
the
silence
of
the
seas
among
the
farthest
hebrides.â€
every
scheme
for
the
analysis
of
nature
has
to
face
these
two
facts
change
and
endurance
there
is
yet
a
third
fact
to
be
placed
by
it
eternality
i
will
call
it
the
mountain
endures
but
when
after
ages
it
has
been
worn
away
it
has
gone
if
a
replica
arises
it
is
yet
a
new
mountain
a
colour
is
eternal
it
haunts
time
like
a
spirit
it
comes
and
it
goes
but
where
it
comes
it
is
the
same
colour
it
neither
survives
nor
does
it
live
it
appears
when
it
is
wanted
the
mountain
has
to
time
and
space
a
different
relation
from
that
which
colour
has
in
the
previous
lecture
i
was
chiefly
considering
the
relation
to
space-time
of
things
which
in
my
sense
of
the
term
are
eternal
it
was
necessary
to
do
so
before
we
can
pass
to
the
consideration
of
the
things
which
endure
also
we
must
recollect
the
basis
of
our
procedure
i
hold
that
philosophy
is
the
critic
of
abstractions
its
function
is
the
double
one
first
of
harmonising
them
by
assigning
to
them
their
right
relative
status
as
abstractions
and
secondly
of
completing
them
by
direct
comparison
with
more
concrete
intuitions
of
the
universe
and
thereby
promoting
the
formation
of
more
complete
schemes
of
thought
it
is
in
respect
to
this
comparison
that
the
testimony
of
great
poets
is
of
such
importance
their
survival
is
evidence
that
they
express
deep
intuitions
of
mankind
penetrating
into
what
is
universal
in
concrete
fact
philosophy
is
not
one
among
the
sciences
with
its
own
little
scheme
of
abstractions
which
it
works
away
at
perfecting
and
improving
it
is
the
survey
of
sciences
with
the
special
objects
of
their
harmony
and
of
their
completion
it
brings
to
this
task
not
only
the
evidence
of
the
separate
sciences
but
also
its
own
appeal
to
concrete
experience
it
confronts
the
sciences
with
concrete
fact
the
literature
of
the
nineteenth
century
especially
its
english
poetic
literature
is
a
witness
to
the
discord
between
the
aesthetic
intuitions
of
mankind
and
the
mechanism
of
science
shelley
brings
vividly
before
us
the
elusiveness
of
the
eternal
objects
of
sense
as
they
haunt
the
change
which
infects
underlying
organisms
wordsworth
is
the
poet
of
nature
as
being
the
field
of
enduring
permanences
carrying
within
themselves
a
message
of
tremendous
significance
the
eternal
objects
are
also
there
for
him
â€œthe
light
that
never
was
on
sea
or
land.â€
both
shelley
and
wordsworth
emphatically
bear
witness
that
nature
cannot
be
divorced
from
its
aesthetic
values
and
that
these
values
arise
from
the
cumulation
in
some
sense
of
the
brooding
presence
of
the
whole
onto
its
various
parts
thus
we
gain
from
the
poets
the
doctrine
that
a
philosophy
of
nature
must
concern
itself
at
least
with
these
five
notions:
change
value
eternal
objects
endurance
organism
interfusion
we
see
that
the
literary
romantic
movement
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
just
as
much
as
berkeleyâ€™s
philosophical
idealistic
movement
a
hundred
years
earlier
refused
to
be
confined
within
the
materialistic
concepts
of
the
orthodox
scientific
theory
we
know
also
that
when
in
these
lectures
we
come
to
the
twentieth
century
we
shall
find
a
movement
in
science
itself
to
reorganise
its
concepts
driven
thereto
by
its
own
intrinsic
development
it
is
however
impossible
to
proceed
until
we
have
settled
whether
this
refashioning
of
ideas
is
to
be
carried
out
on
an
objectivist
basis
or
on
a
subjectivist
basis
by
a
subjectivist
basis
i
mean
the
belief
that
the
nature
of
our
immediate
experience
is
the
outcome
of
the
perceptive
peculiarities
of
the
subject
enjoying
the
experience
in
other
words
i
mean
that
for
this
theory
what
is
perceived
is
not
a
partial
vision
of
a
complex
of
things
generally
independent
of
that
act
of
cognition
but
that
it
merely
is
the
expression
of
the
individual
peculiarities
of
the
cognitive
act
accordingly
what
is
common
to
the
multiplicity
of
cognitive
acts
is
the
ratiocination
connected
with
them
thus
though
there
is
a
common
world
of
thought
associated
with
our
sense-perceptions
there
is
no
common
world
to
think
about
what
we
do
think
about
is
a
common
conceptual
world
applying
indifferently
to
our
individual
experiences
which
are
strictly
personal
to
ourselves
such
a
conceptual
world
will
ultimately
find
its
complete
expression
in
the
equations
of
applied
mathematics
this
is
the
extreme
subjectivist
position
there
is
of
course
the
half-way
house
of
those
who
believe
that
our
perceptual
experience
does
tell
us
of
a
common
objective
world
but
that
the
things
perceived
are
merely
the
outcome
for
us
of
this
world
and
are
not
in
themselves
elements
in
the
common
world
itself
also
there
is
the
objectivist
position
this
creed
is
that
the
actual
elements
perceived
by
our
senses
are
in
themselves
the
elements
of
a
common
world
and
that
this
world
is
a
complex
of
things
including
indeed
our
acts
of
cognition
but
transcending
them
according
to
this
point
of
view
the
things
experienced
are
to
be
distinguished
from
our
knowledge
of
them
so
far
as
there
is
dependence
the
things
pave
the
way
for
the
cognition
rather
than
vice
versa
but
the
point
is
that
the
actual
things
experienced
enter
into
a
common
world
which
transcends
knowledge
though
it
includes
knowledge
the
intermediate
subjectivists
would
hold
that
the
things
experienced
only
indirectly
enter
into
the
common
world
by
reason
of
their
dependence
on
the
subject
who
is
cognising
the
objectivist
holds
that
the
things
experienced
and
the
cognisant
subject
enter
into
the
common
world
on
equal
terms
in
these
lectures
i
am
giving
the
outline
of
what
i
consider
to
be
the
essentials
of
an
objectivist
philosophy
adapted
to
the
requirement
of
science
and
to
the
concrete
experience
of
mankind
apart
from
the
detailed
criticism
of
the
difficulties
raised
by
subjectivism
in
any
form
my
broad
reasons
for
distrusting
it
are
three
in
number
one
reason
arises
from
the
direct
interrogation
of
our
perceptive
experience
it
appears
from
this
interrogation
that
we
are
within
a
world
of
colours
sounds
and
other
sense-objects
related
in
space
and
time
to
enduring
objects
such
as
stones
trees
and
human
bodies
we
seem
to
be
ourselves
elements
of
this
world
in
the
same
sense
as
are
the
other
things
which
we
perceive
but
the
subjectivist
even
the
moderate
intermediate
subjectivist
makes
this
world
as
thus
described
depend
on
us
in
a
way
which
directly
traverses
our
naã¯ve
experience
i
hold
that
the
ultimate
appeal
is
to
naã¯ve
experience
and
that
is
why
i
lay
such
stress
on
the
evidence
of
poetry
my
point
is
that
in
our
sense-experience
we
know
away
from
and
beyond
our
own
personality
whereas
the
subjectivist
holds
that
in
such
experience
we
merely
know
about
our
own
personality
even
the
intermediate
subjectivist
places
our
personality
between
the
world
we
know
of
and
the
common
world
which
he
admits
the
world
we
know
of
is
for
him
the
internal
strain
of
our
personality
under
the
stress
of
the
common
world
which
lies
behind
my
second
reason
for
distrusting
subjectivism
is
based
on
the
particular
content
of
experience
our
historical
knowledge
tells
us
of
ages
in
the
past
when
so
far
as
we
can
see
no
living
being
existed
on
earth
again
it
also
tells
us
of
countless
star-systems
whose
detailed
history
remains
beyond
our
ken
consider
even
the
moon
and
the
earth
what
is
going
on
within
the
interior
of
the
earth
and
on
the
far
side
of
the
moon
our
perceptions
lead
us
to
infer
that
there
is
something
happening
in
the
stars
something
happening
within
the
earth
and
something
happening
on
the
far
side
of
the
moon
also
they
tell
us
that
in
remote
ages
there
were
things
happening
but
all
these
things
which
it
appears
certainly
happened
are
either
unknown
in
detail
or
else
are
reconstructed
by
inferential
evidence
in
the
face
of
this
content
of
our
personal
experience
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
the
experienced
world
is
an
attribute
of
our
own
personality
my
third
reason
is
based
upon
the
instinct
for
action
just
as
sense-perception
seems
to
give
knowledge
of
what
lies
beyond
individuality
so
action
seems
to
issue
in
an
instinct
for
self-transcendence
the
activity
passes
beyond
self
into
the
known
transcendent
world
it
is
here
that
final
ends
are
of
importance
for
it
is
not
activity
urged
from
behind
which
passes
out
into
the
veiled
world
of
the
intermediate
subjectivist
it
is
activity
directed
to
determinate
ends
in
the
known
world
and
yet
it
is
activity
transcending
self
and
it
is
activity
within
the
known
world
it
follows
therefore
that
the
world
as
known
transcends
the
subject
which
is
cognisant
of
it
the
subjectivist
position
has
been
popular
among
those
who
have
been
engaged
in
giving
a
philosophical
interpretation
to
the
recent
theories
of
relativity
in
physical
science
the
dependence
of
the
world
of
sense
on
the
individual
percipient
seems
an
easy
mode
of
expressing
the
meanings
involved
of
course
with
the
exception
of
those
who
are
content
with
themselves
as
forming
the
entire
universe
solitary
amid
nothing
everyone
wants
to
struggle
back
to
some
sort
of
objectivist
position
i
do
not
understand
how
a
common
world
of
thought
can
be
established
in
the
absence
of
a
common
world
of
sense
i
will
not
argue
this
point
in
detail
but
in
the
absence
of
a
transcendence
of
thought
or
a
transcendence
of
the
world
of
sense
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
the
subjectivist
is
to
divest
himself
of
his
solitariness
nor
does
the
intermediate
subjectivist
appear
to
get
any
help
from
his
unknown
world
in
the
background
the
distinction
between
realism
and
idealism
does
not
coincide
with
that
between
objectivism
and
subjectivism
both
realists
and
idealists
can
start
from
an
objective
standpoint
they
may
both
agree
that
the
world
disclosed
in
sense-perception
is
a
common
world
transcending
the
individual
percipient
but
the
objective
idealist
when
he
comes
to
analyse
what
the
reality
of
this
world
involves
finds
that
cognitive
mentality
is
in
some
way
inextricably
concerned
in
every
detail
this
position
the
realist
denies
accordingly
these
two
classes
of
objectivists
do
not
part
company
till
they
have
arrived
at
the
ultimate
problem
of
metaphysics
there
is
a
great
deal
which
they
share
in
common
this
is
why
in
my
last
lecture
i
said
that
i
adopted
a
position
of
provisional
realism
in
the
past
the
objectivist
position
has
been
distorted
by
the
supposed
necessity
of
accepting
the
classical
scientific
materialism
with
its
doctrine
of
simple
location
this
has
necessitated
the
doctrine
of
secondary
and
primary
qualities
thus
the
secondary
qualities
such
as
the
sense-objects
are
dealt
with
on
subjectivist
principles
this
is
a
half-hearted
position
which
falls
an
easy
prey
to
subjectivist
criticism
if
we
are
to
include
the
secondary
qualities
in
the
common
world
a
very
drastic
reorganisation
of
our
fundamental
concepts
is
necessary
it
is
an
evident
fact
of
experience
that
our
apprehensions
of
the
external
world
depend
absolutely
on
the
occurrences
within
the
human
body
by
playing
appropriate
tricks
on
the
body
a
man
can
be
got
to
perceive
or
not
to
perceive
almost
anything
some
people
express
themselves
as
though
bodies
brains
and
nerves
were
the
only
real
things
in
an
entirely
imaginary
world
in
other
words
they
treat
bodies
on
objectivist
principles
and
the
rest
of
the
world
on
subjectivist
principles
this
will
not
do
especially
when
we
remember
that
it
is
the
experimenterâ€™s
perception
of
another
personâ€™s
body
which
is
in
question
as
evidence
but
we
have
to
admit
that
the
body
is
the
organism
whose
states
regulate
our
cognisance
of
the
world
the
unity
of
the
perceptual
field
therefore
must
be
a
unity
of
bodily
experience
in
being
aware
of
the
bodily
experience
we
must
thereby
be
aware
of
aspects
of
the
whole
spatio-temporal
world
as
mirrored
within
the
bodily
life
this
is
the
solution
of
the
problem
which
i
gave
in
my
last
lecture
i
will
not
repeat
myself
now
except
to
remind
you
that
my
theory
involves
the
entire
abandonment
of
the
notion
that
simple
location
is
the
primary
way
in
which
things
are
involved
in
space-time
in
a
certain
sense
everything
is
everywhere
at
all
times
for
every
location
involves
an
aspect
of
itself
in
every
other
location
thus
every
spatio-temporal
standpoint
mirrors
the
world
if
you
try
to
imagine
this
doctrine
in
terms
of
our
conventional
views
of
space
and
time
which
presuppose
simple
location
it
is
a
great
paradox
but
if
you
think
of
it
in
terms
of
our
naã¯ve
experience
it
is
a
mere
transcript
of
the
obvious
facts
you
are
in
a
certain
place
perceiving
things
your
perception
takes
place
where
you
are
and
is
entirely
dependent
on
how
your
body
is
functioning
but
this
functioning
of
the
body
in
one
place
exhibits
for
your
cognisance
an
aspect
of
the
distant
environment
fading
away
into
the
general
knowledge
that
there
are
things
beyond
if
this
cognisance
conveys
knowledge
of
a
transcendent
world
it
must
be
because
the
event
which
is
the
bodily
life
unifies
in
itself
aspects
of
the
universe
this
is
a
doctrine
extremely
consonant
with
the
vivid
expression
of
personal
experience
which
we
find
in
the
nature-poetry
of
imaginative
writers
such
as
wordsworth
or
shelley
the
brooding
immediate
presences
of
things
are
an
obsession
to
wordsworth
what
the
theory
does
do
is
to
edge
cognitive
mentality
away
from
being
the
necessary
substratum
of
the
unity
of
experience
that
unity
is
now
placed
in
the
unity
of
an
event
accompanying
this
unity
there
may
or
there
may
not
be
cognition
at
this
point
we
come
back
to
the
great
question
which
was
posed
before
us
by
our
examination
of
the
evidence
afforded
by
the
poetic
insight
of
wordsworth
and
shelley
this
single
question
has
expanded
into
a
group
of
questions
what
are
enduring
things
as
distinguished
from
the
eternal
objects
such
as
colour
and
shape?
how
are
they
possible?
what
is
their
status
and
meaning
in
the
universe?
it
comes
to
this:
what
is
the
status
of
the
enduring
stability
of
the
order
of
nature?
there
is
the
summary
answer
which
refers
nature
to
some
greater
reality
standing
behind
it
this
reality
occurs
in
the
history
of
thought
under
many
names
the
absolute
brahma
the
order
of
heaven
god
the
delineation
of
final
metaphysical
truth
is
no
part
of
this
lecture
my
point
is
that
any
summary
conclusion
jumping
from
our
conviction
of
the
existence
of
such
an
order
of
nature
to
the
easy
assumption
that
there
is
an
ultimate
reality
which
in
some
unexplained
way
is
to
be
appealed
to
for
the
removal
of
perplexity
constitutes
the
great
refusal
of
rationality
to
assert
its
rights
we
have
to
search
whether
nature
does
not
in
its
very
being
show
itself
as
self-explanatory
by
this
i
mean
that
the
sheer
statement
of
what
things
are
may
contain
elements
explanatory
of
why
things
are
such
elements
may
be
expected
to
refer
to
depths
beyond
anything
which
we
can
grasp
with
a
clear
apprehension
in
a
sense
all
explanation
must
end
in
an
ultimate
arbitrariness
my
demand
is
that
the
ultimate
arbitrariness
of
matter
of
fact
from
which
our
formulation
starts
should
disclose
the
same
general
principles
of
reality
which
we
dimly
discern
as
stretching
away
into
regions
beyond
our
explicit
powers
of
discernment
nature
exhibits
itself
as
exemplifying
a
philosophy
of
the
evolution
of
organisms
subject
to
determinate
conditions
examples
of
such
conditions
are
the
dimensions
of
space
the
laws
of
nature
the
determinate
enduring
entities
such
as
atoms
and
electrons
which
exemplify
these
laws
but
the
very
nature
of
these
entities
the
very
nature
of
their
spatiality
and
temporality
should
exhibit
the
arbitrariness
of
these
conditions
as
the
outcome
of
a
wider
evolution
beyond
nature
itself
and
within
which
nature
is
but
a
limited
mode
one
all-pervasive
fact
inherent
in
the
very
character
of
what
is
real
is
the
transition
of
things
the
passage
one
to
another
this
passage
is
not
a
mere
linear
procession
of
discrete
entities
however
we
fix
a
determinate
entity
there
is
always
a
narrower
determination
of
something
which
is
presupposed
in
our
first
choice
also
there
is
always
a
wider
determination
into
which
our
first
choice
fades
by
transition
beyond
itself
the
general
aspect
of
nature
is
that
of
evolutionary
expansiveness
these
unities
which
i
call
events
are
the
emergence
into
actuality
of
something
how
are
we
to
characterise
the
something
which
thus
emerges?
the
name
â€˜_event_â€™
given
to
such
a
unity
draws
attention
to
the
inherent
transitoriness
combined
with
the
actual
unity
but
this
abstract
word
cannot
be
sufficient
to
characterise
what
the
fact
of
the
reality
of
an
event
is
in
itself
a
momentâ€™s
thought
shows
us
that
no
one
idea
can
in
itself
be
sufficient
for
every
idea
which
finds
its
significance
in
each
event
must
represent
something
which
contributes
to
what
realisation
is
in
itself
thus
no
one
word
can
be
adequate
but
conversely
nothing
must
be
left
out
remembering
the
poetic
rendering
of
our
concrete
experience
we
see
at
once
that
the
element
of
value
of
being
valuable
of
having
value
of
being
an
end
in
itself
of
being
something
which
is
for
its
own
sake
must
not
be
omitted
in
any
account
of
an
event
as
the
most
concrete
actual
something
â€˜valueâ€™
is
the
word
i
use
for
the
intrinsic
reality
of
an
event
value
is
an
element
which
permeates
through
and
through
the
poetic
view
of
nature
we
have
only
to
transfer
to
the
very
texture
of
realisation
in
itself
that
value
which
we
recognise
so
readily
in
terms
of
human
life
this
is
the
secret
of
wordsworthâ€™s
worship
of
nature
realization
therefore
is
in
itself
the
attainment
of
value
but
there
is
no
such
thing
as
mere
value
value
is
the
outcome
of
limitation
the
definite
finite
entity
is
the
selected
mode
which
is
the
shaping
of
attainment
apart
from
such
shaping
into
individual
matter
of
fact
there
is
no
attainment
the
mere
fusion
of
all
that
there
is
would
be
the
nonentity
of
indefiniteness
the
salvation
of
reality
is
its
obstinate
irreducible
matter-of-fact
entities
which
are
limited
to
be
no
other
than
themselves
neither
science
nor
art
nor
creative
action
can
tear
itself
away
from
obstinate
irreducible
limited
facts
the
endurance
of
things
has
its
significance
in
the
self-retention
of
that
which
imposes
itself
as
a
definite
attainment
for
its
own
sake
that
which
endures
is
limited
obstructive
intolerant
infecting
its
environment
with
its
own
aspects
but
it
is
not
self-sufficient
the
aspects
of
all
things
enter
into
its
very
nature
it
is
only
itself
as
drawing
together
into
its
own
limitation
the
larger
whole
in
which
it
finds
itself
conversely
it
is
only
itself
by
lending
its
aspects
to
this
same
environment
in
which
it
finds
itself
the
problem
of
evolution
is
the
development
of
enduring
harmonies
of
enduring
shapes
of
value
which
merge
into
higher
attainments
of
things
beyond
themselves
aesthetic
attainment
is
interwoven
in
the
texture
of
realisation
the
endurance
of
an
entity
represents
the
attainment
of
a
limited
aesthetic
success
though
if
we
look
beyond
it
to
its
external
effects
it
may
represent
an
aesthetic
failure
even
within
itself
it
may
represent
the
conflict
between
a
lower
success
and
a
higher
failure
the
conflict
is
the
presage
of
disruption
the
further
discussion
of
the
nature
of
enduring
objects
and
of
the
conditions
they
require
will
be
relevant
to
the
consideration
of
the
doctrine
of
evolution
which
dominated
the
latter
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
point
which
in
this
lecture
i
have
endeavoured
to
make
clear
is
that
the
nature-poetry
of
the
romantic
revival
was
a
protest
on
behalf
of
the
organic
view
of
nature
and
also
a
protest
against
the
exclusion
of
value
from
the
essence
of
matter
of
fact
in
this
aspect
of
it
the
romantic
movement
may
be
conceived
as
a
revival
of
berkeleyâ€™s
protest
which
had
been
launched
a
hundred
years
earlier
the
romantic
reaction
was
a
protest
on
behalf
of
value
chapter
vi
the
nineteenth
century
my
previous
lecture
was
occupied
with
the
comparison
of
the
nature-poetry
of
the
romantic
movement
in
england
with
the
materialistic
scientific
philosophy
inherited
from
the
eighteenth
century
it
noted
the
entire
disagreement
of
the
two
movements
of
thought
the
lecture
also
continued
the
endeavour
to
outline
an
objectivist
philosophy
capable
of
bridging
the
gap
between
science
and
that
fundamental
intuition
of
mankind
which
finds
its
expression
in
poetry
and
its
practical
exemplification
in
the
presuppositions
of
daily
life
as
the
nineteenth
century
passed
on
the
romantic
movement
died
down
it
did
not
die
away
but
it
lost
its
clear
unity
of
tidal
stream
and
dispersed
itself
into
many
estuaries
as
it
coalesced
with
other
human
interests
the
faith
of
the
century
was
derived
from
three
sources:
one
source
was
the
romantic
movement
showing
itself
in
religious
revival
in
art
and
in
political
aspiration:
another
source
was
the
gathering
advance
of
science
which
opened
avenues
of
thought:
the
third
source
was
the
advance
in
technology
which
completely
changed
the
conditions
of
human
life
each
of
these
springs
of
faith
had
its
origin
in
the
previous
period
the
french
revolution
itself
was
the
first
child
of
romanticism
in
the
form
in
which
it
tinged
rousseau
james
watt
obtained
his
patent
for
his
steam-engine
in
1769
the
scientific
advance
was
the
glory
of
france
and
of
french
influence
throughout
the
same
century
also
even
during
this
earlier
period
the
streams
interacted
coalesced
and
antagonised
each
other
but
it
was
not
until
the
nineteenth
century
that
the
threefold
movement
came
to
that
full
development
and
peculiar
balance
characteristic
of
the
sixty
years
following
the
battle
of
waterloo
what
is
peculiar
and
new
to
the
century
differentiating
it
from
all
its
predecessors
is
its
technology
it
was
not
merely
the
introduction
of
some
great
isolated
inventions
it
is
impossible
not
to
feel
that
something
more
than
that
was
involved
for
example
writing
was
a
greater
invention
than
the
steam-engine
but
in
tracing
the
continuous
history
of
the
growth
of
writing
we
find
an
immense
difference
from
that
of
the
steam-engine
we
must
of
course
put
aside
minor
and
sporadic
anticipations
of
both
and
confine
attention
to
the
periods
of
their
effective
elaboration
the
scale
of
time
is
so
absolutely
disparate
for
the
steam-engine
we
may
give
about
a
hundred
years
for
writing
the
time
period
is
of
the
order
of
a
thousand
years
further
when
writing
was
finally
popularised
the
world
was
not
then
expecting
the
next
step
in
technology
the
process
of
change
was
slow
unconscious
and
unexpected
in
the
nineteenth
century
the
process
became
quick
conscious
and
expected
the
earlier
half
of
the
century
was
the
period
in
which
this
new
attitude
to
change
was
first
established
and
enjoyed
it
was
a
peculiar
period
of
hope
in
the
sense
in
which
sixty
or
seventy
years
later
we
can
now
detect
a
note
of
disillusionment
or
at
least
of
anxiety
the
greatest
invention
of
the
nineteenth
century
was
the
invention
of
the
method
of
invention
a
new
method
entered
into
life
in
order
to
understand
our
epoch
we
can
neglect
all
the
details
of
change
such
as
railways
telegraphs
radios
spinning
machines
synthetic
dyes
we
must
concentrate
on
the
method
in
itself
that
is
the
real
novelty
which
has
broken
up
the
foundations
of
the
old
civilisation
the
prophecy
of
francis
bacon
has
now
been
fulfilled
and
man
who
at
times
dreamt
of
himself
as
a
little
lower
than
the
angels
has
submitted
to
become
the
servant
and
the
minister
of
nature
it
still
remains
to
be
seen
whether
the
same
actor
can
play
both
parts
the
whole
change
has
arisen
from
the
new
scientific
information
science
conceived
not
so
much
in
its
principles
as
in
its
results
is
an
obvious
storehouse
of
ideas
for
utilisation
but
if
we
are
to
understand
what
happened
during
the
century
the
analogy
of
a
mine
is
better
than
that
of
a
storehouse
also
it
is
a
great
mistake
to
think
that
the
bare
scientific
idea
is
the
required
invention
so
that
it
has
only
to
be
picked
up
and
used
an
intense
period
of
imaginative
design
lies
between
one
element
in
the
new
method
is
just
the
discovery
of
how
to
set
about
bridging
the
gap
between
the
scientific
ideas
and
the
ultimate
product
it
is
a
process
of
disciplined
attack
upon
one
difficulty
after
another
the
possibilities
of
modern
technology
were
first
in
practice
realised
in
england
by
the
energy
of
a
prosperous
middle
class
accordingly
the
industrial
revolution
started
there
but
the
germans
explicitly
realised
the
methods
by
which
the
deeper
veins
in
the
mine
of
science
could
be
reached
they
abolished
haphazard
methods
of
scholarship
in
their
technological
schools
and
universities
progress
did
not
have
to
wait
for
the
occasional
genius
or
the
occasional
lucky
thought
their
feats
of
scholarship
during
the
nineteenth
century
were
the
admiration
of
the
world
this
discipline
of
knowledge
applies
beyond
technology
to
pure
science
and
beyond
science
to
general
scholarship
it
represents
the
change
from
amateurs
to
professionals
there
have
always
been
people
who
devoted
their
lives
to
definite
regions
of
thought
in
particular
lawyers
and
the
clergy
of
the
christian
churches
form
obvious
examples
of
such
specialism
but
the
full
self-conscious
realisation
of
the
power
of
professionalism
in
knowledge
in
all
its
departments
and
of
the
way
to
produce
the
professionals
and
of
the
importance
of
knowledge
to
the
advance
of
technology
and
of
the
methods
by
which
abstract
knowledge
can
be
connected
with
technology
and
of
the
boundless
possibilities
of
technological
advance,â€”the
realisation
of
all
these
things
was
first
completely
attained
in
the
nineteenth
century
and
among
the
various
countries
chiefly
in
germany
in
the
past
human
life
was
lived
in
a
bullock
cart
in
the
future
it
will
be
lived
in
an
aeroplane
and
the
change
of
speed
amounts
to
a
difference
in
quality
the
transformation
of
the
field
of
knowledge
which
has
been
thus
effected
has
not
been
wholly
a
gain
at
least
there
are
dangers
implicit
in
it
although
the
increase
of
efficiency
is
undeniable
the
discussion
of
various
effects
on
social
life
arising
from
the
new
situation
is
reserved
for
my
last
lecture
for
the
present
it
is
sufficient
to
note
that
this
novel
situation
of
disciplined
progress
is
the
setting
within
which
the
thought
of
the
century
developed
in
the
period
considered
four
great
novel
ideas
were
introduced
into
theoretical
science
of
course
it
is
possible
to
show
good
cause
for
increasing
my
list
far
beyond
the
number
four
but
i
am
keeping
to
ideas
which
if
taken
in
their
broadest
signification
are
vital
to
modern
attempts
at
reconstructing
the
foundations
of
physical
science
two
of
these
ideas
are
antithetical
and
i
will
consider
them
together
we
are
not
concerned
with
details
but
with
ultimate
influences
on
thought
one
of
the
ideas
is
that
of
a
field
of
physical
activity
pervading
all
space
even
where
there
is
an
apparent
vacuum
this
notion
had
occurred
to
many
people
under
many
forms
we
remember
the
medieval
axiom
nature
abhors
a
vacuum
also
descartesâ€™
vortices
at
one
time
in
the
seventeenth
century
seemed
as
if
established
among
scientific
assumptions
newton
believed
that
gravitation
was
caused
by
something
happening
in
a
medium
but
on
the
whole
in
the
eighteenth
century
nothing
was
made
of
any
of
these
ideas
the
passage
of
light
was
explained
in
newtonâ€™s
fashion
by
the
flight
of
minute
corpuscles
which
of
course
left
room
for
a
vacuum
mathematical
physicists
were
far
too
busy
deducing
the
consequences
of
the
theory
of
gravitation
to
bother
much
about
the
causes
nor
did
they
know
where
to
look
if
they
had
troubled
themselves
over
the
question
there
were
speculations
but
their
importance
was
not
great
accordingly
when
the
nineteenth
century
opened
the
notion
of
physical
occurrences
pervading
all
space
held
no
effective
place
in
science
it
was
revived
from
two
sources
the
undulatory
theory
of
light
triumphed
thanks
to
thomas
young
and
fresnel
this
demands
that
there
shall
be
something
throughout
space
which
can
undulate
accordingly
the
ether
was
produced
as
a
sort
of
all
pervading
subtle
material
again
the
theory
of
electromagnetism
finally
in
clerk
maxwellâ€™s
hands
assumed
a
shape
in
which
it
demanded
that
there
should
be
electromagnetic
occurrences
throughout
all
space
maxwellâ€™s
complete
theory
was
not
shaped
until
the
eighteen-seventies
but
it
had
been
prepared
for
by
many
great
men
ampã¨re
oersted
faraday
in
accordance
with
the
current
materialistic
outlook
these
electromagnetic
occurrences
also
required
a
material
in
which
to
happen
so
again
the
ether
was
requisitioned
then
maxwell
as
the
immediate
first-fruits
of
his
theory
demonstrated
that
the
waves
of
light
were
merely
waves
of
his
electromagnetic
occurrences
accordingly
the
theory
of
electromagnetism
swallowed
up
the
theory
of
light
it
was
a
great
simplification
and
no
one
doubts
its
truth
but
it
had
one
unfortunate
effect
so
far
as
materialism
was
concerned
for
whereas
quite
a
simple
sort
of
elastic
ether
sufficed
for
light
when
taken
by
itself
the
electromagnetic
ether
has
to
be
endowed
with
just
those
properties
necessary
for
the
production
of
the
electromagnetic
occurrences
in
fact
it
becomes
a
mere
name
for
the
material
which
is
postulated
to
underlie
these
occurrences
if
you
do
not
happen
to
hold
the
metaphysical
theory
which
makes
you
postulate
such
an
ether
you
can
discard
it
for
it
has
no
independent
vitality
thus
in
the
seventies
of
the
last
century
some
main
physical
sciences
were
established
on
a
basis
which
presupposed
the
idea
of
continuity
on
the
other
hand
the
idea
of
atomicity
had
been
introduced
by
john
dalton
to
complete
lavoisierâ€™s
work
on
the
foundation
of
chemistry
this
is
the
second
great
notion
ordinary
matter
was
conceived
as
atomic:
electromagnetic
effects
were
conceived
as
arising
from
a
continuous
field
there
was
no
contradiction
in
the
first
place
the
notions
are
antithetical
but
apart
from
special
embodiments
are
not
logically
contradictory
secondly
they
were
applied
to
different
regions
of
science
one
to
chemistry
and
the
other
to
electromagnetism
and
as
yet
there
were
but
faint
signs
of
coalescence
between
the
two
the
notion
of
matter
as
atomic
has
a
long
history
democritus
and
lucretius
will
at
once
occur
to
your
minds
in
speaking
of
these
ideas
as
novel
i
merely
mean
relatively
novel
having
regard
to
the
settlement
of
ideas
which
formed
the
efficient
basis
of
science
throughout
the
eighteenth
century
in
considering
the
history
of
thought
it
is
necessary
to
distinguish
the
real
stream
determining
a
period
from
ineffectual
thoughts
casually
entertained
in
the
eighteenth
century
every
well-educated
man
read
lucretius
and
entertained
ideas
about
atoms
but
john
dalton
made
them
efficient
in
the
stream
of
science
and
in
this
function
of
efficiency
atomicity
was
a
new
idea
the
influence
of
atomicity
was
not
limited
to
chemistry
the
living
cell
is
to
biology
what
the
electron
and
the
proton
are
to
physics
apart
from
cells
and
from
aggregates
of
cells
there
are
no
biological
phenomena
the
cell
theory
was
introduced
into
biology
contemporaneously
with
and
independently
of
daltonâ€™s
atomic
theory
the
two
theories
are
independent
exemplifications
of
the
same
idea
of
â€˜atomism.â€™
the
biological
cell
theory
was
a
gradual
growth
and
a
mere
list
of
dates
and
names
illustrates
the
fact
that
the
biological
sciences
as
effective
schemes
of
thought
are
barely
one
hundred
years
old
bichã¢t
in
1801
elaborated
a
tissue
theory:
johannes
mã¼ller
in
1835
described
â€˜cellsâ€™
and
demonstrated
facts
concerning
their
nature
and
relations:
schleiden
in
1838
and
schwann
in
1839
finally
established
their
fundamental
character
thus
by
1840
both
biology
and
chemistry
were
established
on
an
atomic
basis
the
final
triumph
of
atomism
had
to
wait
for
the
arrival
of
electrons
at
the
end
of
the
century
the
importance
of
the
imaginative
background
is
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
nearly
half
a
century
after
dalton
had
done
his
work
another
chemist
louis
pasteur
carried
over
these
same
ideas
of
atomicity
still
further
into
the
region
of
biology
the
cell
theory
and
pasteurâ€™s
work
were
in
some
respects
more
revolutionary
than
that
of
dalton
for
they
introduced
the
notion
of
organism
into
the
world
of
minute
beings
there
had
been
a
tendency
to
treat
the
atom
as
an
ultimate
entity
capable
only
of
external
relations
this
attitude
of
mind
was
breaking
down
under
the
influence
of
mendeleefâ€™s
periodic
law
but
pasteur
showed
the
decisive
importance
of
the
idea
of
organism
at
the
stage
of
infinitesimal
magnitude
the
astronomers
had
shown
us
how
big
is
the
universe
the
chemists
and
biologists
teach
us
how
small
it
is
there
is
in
modern
scientific
practice
a
famous
standard
of
length
it
is
rather
small:
to
obtain
it
you
must
divide
a
centimetre
into
one
hundred
million
parts
and
take
one
of
them
pasteurâ€™s
organisms
are
a
good
deal
bigger
than
this
length
in
connection
with
atoms
we
now
know
that
there
are
organisms
for
which
such
distances
are
uncomfortably
great
the
remaining
pair
of
new
ideas
to
be
ascribed
to
this
epoch
are
both
of
them
connected
with
the
notion
of
transition
or
change
they
are
the
doctrine
of
the
conservation
of
energy
and
the
doctrine
of
evolution
the
doctrine
of
energy
has
to
do
with
the
notion
of
quantitative
permanence
underlying
change
the
doctrine
of
evolution
has
to
do
with
the
emergence
of
novel
organisms
as
the
outcome
of
change
the
theory
of
energy
lies
in
the
province
of
physics
the
theory
of
evolution
lies
mainly
in
the
province
of
biology
although
it
had
previously
been
touched
upon
by
kant
and
laplace
in
connection
with
the
formation
of
suns
and
planets
the
convergent
effect
of
the
new
power
for
scientific
advance
which
resulted
from
these
four
ideas
transformed
the
middle
period
of
the
century
into
an
orgy
of
scientific
triumph
clear-sighted
men
of
the
sort
who
are
so
clearly
wrong
now
proclaimed
that
the
secrets
of
the
physical
universe
were
finally
disclosed
if
only
you
ignored
everything
which
refused
to
come
into
line
your
powers
of
explanation
were
unlimited
on
the
other
side
muddle-headed
men
muddled
themselves
into
the
most
indefensible
positions
learned
dogmatism
conjoined
with
ignorance
of
the
crucial
facts
suffered
a
heavy
defeat
from
the
scientific
advocates
of
new
ways
thus
to
the
excitement
derived
from
technological
revolution
there
was
now
added
the
excitement
arising
from
the
vistas
disclosed
by
scientific
theory
both
the
material
and
the
spiritual
bases
of
social
life
were
in
process
of
transformation
when
the
century
entered
upon
its
last
quarter
its
three
sources
of
inspiration
the
romantic
the
technological
and
the
scientific
had
done
their
work
then
almost
suddenly
a
pause
occurred
and
in
its
last
twenty
years
the
century
closed
with
one
of
the
dullest
stages
of
thought
since
the
time
of
the
first
crusade
it
was
an
echo
of
the
eighteenth
century
lacking
voltaire
and
the
reckless
grace
of
the
french
aristocrats
the
period
was
efficient
dull
and
half-hearted
it
celebrated
the
triumph
of
the
professional
man
but
looking
backwards
upon
this
time
of
pause
we
can
now
discern
signs
of
change
in
the
first
place
the
modern
conditions
of
systematic
research
prevent
absolute
stagnation
in
every
branch
of
science
there
was
effective
progress
indeed
rapid
progress
although
it
was
confined
somewhat
strictly
within
the
accepted
ideas
of
each
branch
it
was
an
age
of
successful
scientific
orthodoxy
undisturbed
by
much
thought
beyond
the
conventions
in
the
second
place
we
can
now
see
that
the
adequacy
of
scientific
materialism
as
a
scheme
of
thought
for
the
use
of
science
was
endangered
the
conservation
of
energy
provided
a
new
type
of
quantitative
permanence
it
is
true
that
energy
could
be
construed
as
something
subsidiary
to
matter
but
anyhow
the
notion
of
mass
was
losing
its
unique
preeminence
as
being
the
one
final
permanent
quantity
later
on
we
find
the
relations
of
mass
and
energy
inverted
so
that
mass
now
becomes
the
name
for
a
quantity
of
energy
considered
in
relation
to
some
of
its
dynamical
effects
this
train
of
thought
leads
to
the
notion
of
energy
being
fundamental
thus
displacing
matter
from
that
position
but
energy
is
merely
the
name
for
the
quantitative
aspect
of
a
structure
of
happenings
in
short
it
depends
on
the
notion
of
the
functioning
of
an
organism
the
question
is
can
we
define
an
organism
without
recurrence
to
the
concept
of
matter
in
simple
location?
we
must
later
on
consider
this
point
in
more
detail
the
same
relegation
of
matter
to
the
background
occurs
in
connection
with
the
electromagnetic
fields
the
modern
theory
presupposes
happenings
in
that
field
which
are
divorced
from
immediate
dependence
upon
matter
it
is
usual
to
provide
an
ether
as
a
substratum
but
the
ether
does
not
really
enter
into
the
theory
thus
again
the
notion
of
material
loses
its
fundamental
position
also
the
atom
is
transforming
itself
into
an
organism
and
finally
the
evolution
theory
is
nothing
else
than
the
analysis
of
the
conditions
for
the
formation
and
survival
of
various
types
of
organisms
in
truth
one
most
significant
fact
of
this
later
period
is
the
advance
in
biological
sciences
these
sciences
are
essentially
sciences
concerning
organisms
during
the
epoch
in
question
and
indeed
also
at
the
present
moment
the
prestige
of
the
more
perfect
scientific
form
belongs
to
the
physical
sciences
accordingly
biology
apes
the
manners
of
physics
it
is
orthodox
to
hold
that
there
is
nothing
in
biology
but
what
is
physical
mechanism
under
somewhat
complex
circumstances
one
difficulty
in
this
position
is
the
present
confusion
as
to
the
foundational
concepts
of
physical
science
this
same
difficulty
also
attaches
to
the
opposed
doctrine
of
vitalism
for
in
this
later
theory
the
fact
of
mechanism
is
acceptedâ€”i
mean
mechanism
based
upon
materialismâ€”and
an
additional
vital
control
is
introduced
to
explain
the
actions
of
living
bodies
it
cannot
be
too
clearly
understood
that
the
various
physical
laws
which
appear
to
apply
to
the
behaviour
of
atoms
are
not
mutually
consistent
as
at
present
formulated
the
appeal
to
mechanism
on
behalf
of
biology
was
in
its
origin
an
appeal
to
the
well-attested
self-consistent
physical
concepts
as
expressing
the
basis
of
all
natural
phenomena
but
at
present
there
is
no
such
system
of
concepts
science
is
taking
on
a
new
aspect
which
is
neither
purely
physical
nor
purely
biological
it
is
becoming
the
study
of
organisms
biology
is
the
study
of
the
larger
organisms
whereas
physics
is
the
study
of
the
smaller
organisms
there
is
another
difference
between
the
two
divisions
of
science
the
organisms
of
biology
include
as
ingredients
the
smaller
organisms
of
physics
but
there
is
at
present
no
evidence
that
the
smaller
of
the
physical
organisms
can
be
analysed
into
component
organisms
it
may
be
so
but
anyhow
we
are
faced
with
the
question
as
to
whether
there
are
not
primary
organisms
which
are
incapable
of
further
analysis
it
seems
very
unlikely
that
there
should
be
any
infinite
regress
in
nature
accordingly
a
theory
of
science
which
discards
materialism
must
answer
the
question
as
to
the
character
of
these
primary
entities
there
can
be
only
one
answer
on
this
basis
we
must
start
with
the
event
as
the
ultimate
unit
of
natural
occurrence
an
event
has
to
do
with
all
that
there
is
and
in
particular
with
all
other
events
this
interfusion
of
events
is
effected
by
the
aspects
of
those
eternal
objects
such
as
colours
sounds
scents
geometrical
characters
which
are
required
for
nature
and
are
not
emergent
from
it
such
an
eternal
object
will
be
an
ingredient
of
one
event
under
the
guise
or
aspect
of
qualifying
another
event
there
is
a
reciprocity
of
aspects
and
there
are
patterns
of
aspects
each
event
corresponds
to
two
such
patterns
namely
the
pattern
of
aspects
of
other
events
which
it
grasps
into
its
own
unity
and
the
pattern
of
its
aspects
which
other
events
severally
grasp
into
their
unities
accordingly
a
non-materialistic
philosophy
of
nature
will
identify
a
primary
organism
as
being
the
emergence
of
some
particular
pattern
as
grasped
in
the
unity
of
a
real
event
such
a
pattern
will
also
include
the
aspects
of
the
event
in
question
as
grasped
in
other
events
whereby
those
other
events
receive
a
modification
or
partial
determination
there
is
thus
an
intrinsic
and
an
extrinsic
reality
of
an
event
namely
the
event
as
in
its
own
prehension
and
the
event
as
in
the
prehension
of
other
events
the
concept
of
an
organism
includes
therefore
the
concept
of
the
interaction
of
organisms
the
ordinary
scientific
ideas
of
transmission
and
continuity
are
relatively
speaking
details
concerning
the
empirically
observed
characters
of
these
patterns
throughout
space
and
time
the
position
here
maintained
is
that
the
relationships
of
an
event
are
internal
so
far
as
concerns
the
event
itself
that
is
to
say
that
they
are
constitutive
of
what
the
event
is
in
itself
also
in
the
previous
lecture
we
arrived
at
the
notion
that
an
actual
event
is
an
achievement
for
its
own
sake
a
grasping
of
diverse
entities
into
a
value
by
reason
of
their
real
togetherness
in
that
pattern
to
the
exclusion
of
other
entities
it
is
not
the
mere
logical
togetherness
of
merely
diverse
things
for
in
that
case
to
modify
baconâ€™s
words
â€œall
eternal
objects
would
be
alike
one
to
another.â€
this
reality
means
that
each
intrinsic
essence
that
is
to
say
what
each
eternal
object
is
in
itself
becomes
relevant
to
the
one
limited
value
emergent
in
the
guise
of
the
event
but
values
differ
in
importance
thus
though
each
event
is
necessary
for
the
community
of
events
the
weight
of
its
contribution
is
determined
by
something
intrinsic
in
itself
we
have
now
to
discuss
what
that
property
is
empirical
observation
shows
that
it
is
the
property
which
we
may
call
indifferently
retention
endurance
or
reiteration
this
property
amounts
to
the
recovery
on
behalf
of
value
amid
the
transitoriness
of
reality
of
the
self-identity
which
is
also
enjoyed
by
the
primary
eternal
objects
the
reiteration
of
a
particular
shape
or
formation
of
value
within
an
event
occurs
when
the
event
as
a
whole
repeats
some
shape
which
is
also
exhibited
by
each
one
of
a
succession
of
its
parts
thus
however
you
analyse
the
event
according
to
the
flux
of
its
parts
through
time
there
is
the
same
thing-for-its-own-sake
standing
before
you
thus
the
event
in
its
own
intrinsic
reality
mirrors
in
itself
as
derived
from
its
own
parts
aspects
of
the
same
patterned
value
as
it
realises
in
its
complete
self
it
thus
realises
itself
under
the
guise
of
an
enduring
individual
entity
with
a
life
history
contained
within
itself
furthermore
the
extrinsic
reality
of
such
an
event
as
mirrored
in
other
events
takes
this
same
form
of
an
enduring
individuality
only
in
this
case
the
individuality
is
implanted
as
a
reiteration
of
aspects
of
itself
in
the
alien
events
composing
the
environment
the
total
temporal
duration
of
such
an
event
bearing
an
enduring
pattern
constitutes
its
specious
present
within
this
specious
present
the
event
realises
itself
as
a
totality
and
also
in
so
doing
realises
itself
as
grouping
together
a
number
of
aspects
of
its
own
temporal
parts
one
and
the
same
pattern
is
realised
in
the
total
event
and
is
exhibited
by
each
of
these
various
parts
through
an
aspect
of
each
part
grasped
into
the
togetherness
of
the
total
event
also
the
earlier
life-history
of
the
same
pattern
is
exhibited
by
its
aspects
in
this
total
event
there
is
thus
in
this
event
a
memory
of
the
antecedent
life-history
of
its
own
dominant
pattern
as
having
formed
an
element
of
value
in
its
own
antecedent
environment
this
concrete
prehension
from
within
of
the
life-history
of
an
enduring
fact
is
analysable
into
two
abstractions
of
which
one
is
the
enduring
entity
which
has
emerged
as
a
real
matter
of
fact
to
be
taken
account
of
by
other
things
and
the
other
is
the
individualised
embodiment
of
the
underlying
energy
of
realisation
the
consideration
of
the
general
flux
of
events
leads
to
this
analysis
into
an
underlying
eternal
energy
in
whose
nature
there
stands
an
envisagement
of
the
realm
of
all
eternal
objects
such
an
envisagement
is
the
ground
of
the
individualised
thoughts
which
emerge
as
thought-aspects
grasped
within
the
life-history
of
the
subtler
and
more
complex
enduring
patterns
also
in
the
nature
of
the
eternal
activity
there
must
stand
an
envisagement
of
all
values
to
be
obtained
by
a
real
togetherness
of
eternal
objects
as
envisaged
in
ideal
situations
such
ideal
situations
apart
from
any
reality
are
devoid
of
intrinsic
value
but
are
valuable
as
elements
in
purpose
the
individualised
prehension
into
individual
events
of
aspects
of
these
ideal
situations
takes
the
form
of
individualised
thoughts
and
as
such
has
intrinsic
value
thus
value
arises
because
there
is
now
a
real
togetherness
of
the
ideal
aspects
as
in
thought
with
the
actual
aspects
as
in
process
of
occurrence
accordingly
no
value
is
to
be
ascribed
to
the
underlying
activity
as
divorced
from
the
matter-of-fact
events
of
the
real
world
finally
to
sum
up
this
train
of
thought
the
underlying
activity
as
conceived
apart
from
the
fact
of
realisation
has
three
types
of
envisagement
these
are:
first
the
envisagement
of
eternal
objects
secondly
the
envisagement
of
possibilities
of
value
in
respect
to
the
synthesis
of
eternal
objects
and
lastly
the
envisagement
of
the
actual
matter
of
fact
which
must
enter
into
the
total
situation
which
is
achievable
by
the
addition
of
the
future
but
in
abstraction
from
actuality
the
eternal
activity
is
divorced
from
value
for
the
actuality
is
the
value
the
individual
perception
arising
from
enduring
objects
will
vary
in
its
individual
depth
and
width
according
to
the
way
in
which
the
pattern
dominates
its
own
route
it
may
represent
the
faintest
ripple
differentiating
the
general
substrate
energy
or
in
the
other
extreme
it
may
rise
to
conscious
thought
which
includes
poising
before
self-conscious
judgment
the
abstract
possibilities
of
value
inherent
in
various
situations
of
ideal
togetherness
the
intermediate
cases
will
group
round
the
individual
perception
as
envisaging
without
self-consciousness
that
one
immediate
possibility
of
attainment
which
represents
the
closest
analogy
to
its
own
immediate
past
having
regard
to
the
actual
aspects
which
are
there
for
prehension
the
laws
of
physics
represent
the
harmonised
adjustment
of
development
which
results
from
this
unique
principle
of
determination
thus
dynamics
is
dominated
by
a
principle
of
least
action
whose
detailed
character
has
to
be
learnt
from
observation
the
atomic
material
entities
which
are
considered
in
physical
science
are
merely
these
individual
enduring
entities
conceived
in
abstraction
from
everything
except
what
concerns
their
mutual
interplay
in
determining
each
otherâ€™s
historical
routes
of
life-history
such
entities
are
partially
formed
by
the
inheritance
of
aspects
from
their
own
past
but
they
are
also
partially
formed
by
the
aspects
of
other
events
forming
their
environments
the
laws
of
physics
are
the
laws
declaring
how
the
entities
mutually
react
among
themselves
for
physics
these
laws
are
arbitrary
because
that
science
has
abstracted
from
what
the
entities
are
in
themselves
we
have
seen
that
this
fact
of
what
the
entities
are
in
themselves
is
liable
to
modification
by
their
environments
accordingly
the
assumption
that
no
modification
of
these
laws
is
to
be
looked
for
in
environments
which
have
any
striking
difference
from
the
environments
for
which
the
laws
have
been
observed
to
hold
is
very
unsafe
the
physical
entities
may
be
modified
in
very
essential
ways
so
far
as
these
laws
are
concerned
it
is
even
possible
that
they
may
be
developed
into
individualities
of
more
fundamental
types
with
wider
embodiment
of
envisagement
such
envisagement
might
reach
to
the
attainment
of
the
poising
of
alternative
values
with
exercise
of
choice
lying
outside
the
physical
laws
and
expressible
only
in
terms
of
purpose
apart
from
such
remote
possibilities
it
remains
an
immediate
deduction
that
an
individual
entity
whose
own
life-history
is
a
part
within
the
life-history
of
some
larger
deeper
more
complete
pattern
is
liable
to
have
aspects
of
that
larger
pattern
dominating
its
own
being
and
to
experience
modifications
of
that
larger
pattern
reflected
in
itself
as
modifications
of
its
own
being
this
is
the
theory
of
organic
mechanism
according
to
this
theory
the
evolution
of
laws
of
nature
is
concurrent
with
the
evolution
of
enduring
pattern
for
the
general
state
of
the
universe
as
it
now
is
partly
determines
the
very
essences
of
the
entities
whose
modes
of
functioning
these
laws
express
the
general
principle
is
that
in
a
new
environment
there
is
an
evolution
of
the
old
entities
into
new
forms
this
rapid
outline
of
a
thoroughgoing
organic
theory
of
nature
enables
us
to
understand
the
chief
requisites
of
the
doctrine
of
evolution
the
main
work
proceeding
during
this
pause
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
was
the
absorption
of
this
doctrine
as
guiding
the
methodology
of
all
branches
of
science
by
a
blindness
which
is
almost
judicial
as
being
a
penalty
affixed
to
hasty
superficial
thinking
many
religious
thinkers
opposed
the
new
doctrine
although
in
truth
a
thoroughgoing
evolutionary
philosophy
is
inconsistent
with
materialism
the
aboriginal
stuff
or
material
from
which
a
materialistic
philosophy
starts
is
incapable
of
evolution
this
material
is
in
itself
the
ultimate
substance
evolution
on
the
materialistic
theory
is
reduced
to
the
rã´le
of
being
another
word
for
the
description
of
the
changes
of
the
external
relations
between
portions
of
matter
there
is
nothing
to
evolve
because
one
set
of
external
relations
is
as
good
as
any
other
set
of
external
relations
there
can
merely
be
change
purposeless
and
unprogressive
but
the
whole
point
of
the
modern
doctrine
is
the
evolution
of
the
complex
organisms
from
antecedent
states
of
less
complex
organisms
the
doctrine
thus
cries
aloud
for
a
conception
of
organism
as
fundamental
for
nature
it
also
requires
an
underlying
activityâ€”a
substantial
activityâ€”expressing
itself
in
individual
embodiments
and
evolving
in
achievements
of
organism
the
organism
is
a
unit
of
emergent
value
a
real
fusion
of
the
characters
of
eternal
objects
emerging
for
its
own
sake
thus
in
the
process
of
analysing
the
character
of
nature
in
itself
we
find
that
the
emergence
of
organisms
depends
on
a
selective
activity
which
is
akin
to
purpose
the
point
is
that
the
enduring
organisms
are
now
the
outcome
of
evolution
and
that
beyond
these
organisms
there
is
nothing
else
that
endures
on
the
materialistic
theory
there
is
materialâ€”such
as
matter
or
electricityâ€”which
endures
on
the
organic
theory
the
only
endurances
are
structures
of
activity
and
the
structures
are
evolved
enduring
things
are
thus
the
outcome
of
a
temporal
process
whereas
eternal
things
are
the
elements
required
for
the
very
being
of
the
process
we
can
give
a
precise
definition
of
endurance
in
this
way:
let
an
event
a
be
pervaded
by
an
enduring
structural
pattern
then
a
can
be
exhaustively
subdivided
into
a
temporal
succession
of
events
let
b
be
any
part
of
a
which
is
obtained
by
picking
out
any
one
of
the
events
belonging
to
a
series
which
thus
subdivides
a
then
the
enduring
pattern
is
a
pattern
of
aspects
within
the
complete
pattern
prehended
into
the
unity
of
a
and
it
is
also
a
pattern
within
the
complete
pattern
prehended
into
the
unity
of
any
temporal
slice
of
a
such
as
b
for
example
a
molecule
is
a
pattern
exhibited
in
an
event
of
one
minute
and
of
any
second
of
that
minute
it
is
obvious
that
such
an
enduring
pattern
may
be
of
more
or
of
less
importance
it
may
express
some
slight
fact
connecting
the
underlying
activities
thus
individualised
or
it
may
express
some
very
close
connection
if
the
pattern
which
endures
is
merely
derived
from
the
direct
aspects
of
the
external
environment
mirrored
in
the
standpoints
of
the
various
parts
then
the
endurance
is
an
extrinsic
fact
of
slight
importance
but
if
the
enduring
pattern
is
wholly
derived
from
the
direct
aspects
of
the
various
temporal
sections
of
the
event
in
question
then
the
endurance
is
an
important
intrinsic
fact
it
expresses
a
certain
unity
of
character
uniting
the
underlying
individualised
activities
there
is
then
an
enduring
object
with
a
certain
unity
for
itself
and
for
the
rest
of
nature
let
us
use
the
term
physical
endurance
to
express
endurance
of
this
type
then
physical
endurance
is
the
process
of
continuously
inheriting
a
certain
identity
of
character
transmitted
throughout
a
historical
route
of
events
this
character
belongs
to
the
whole
route
and
to
every
event
of
the
route
this
is
the
exact
property
of
material
if
it
has
existed
for
ten
minutes
it
has
existed
during
every
minute
of
the
ten
minutes
and
during
every
second
of
every
minute
only
if
you
take
material
to
be
fundamental
this
property
of
endurance
is
an
arbitrary
fact
at
the
base
of
the
order
of
nature
but
if
you
take
organism
to
be
fundamental
this
property
is
the
result
of
evolution
it
looks
at
first
sight
as
if
a
physical
object
with
its
process
of
inheritance
from
itself
were
independent
of
the
environment
but
such
a
conclusion
is
not
justified
for
let
b
and
c
be
two
successive
slices
in
the
life
of
such
an
object
such
that
c
succeeds
b
then
the
enduring
pattern
in
c
is
inherited
from
b
and
from
other
analogous
antecedent
parts
of
its
life
it
is
transmitted
through
b
to
c
but
what
is
transmitted
to
c
is
the
complete
pattern
of
aspects
derived
from
such
events
as
b
these
complete
patterns
include
the
influence
of
the
environment
on
b
and
on
the
other
antecedent
parts
of
the
life
of
the
object
thus
the
complete
aspects
of
the
antecedent
life
are
inherited
as
the
partial
pattern
which
endures
throughout
all
the
various
periods
of
the
life
thus
a
favourable
environment
is
essential
to
the
maintenance
of
a
physical
object
nature
as
we
know
it
comprises
enormous
permanences
there
are
the
permanences
of
ordinary
matter
the
molecules
within
the
oldest
rocks
known
to
geologists
may
have
existed
unchanged
for
over
a
thousand
million
years
not
only
unchanged
in
themselves
but
unchanged
in
their
relative
dispositions
to
each
other
in
that
length
of
time
the
number
of
pulsations
of
a
molecule
vibrating
with
the
frequency
of
yellow
sodium
light
would
be
about

until
recently
an
atom
was
apparently
indestructible
we
know
better
now
but
the
indestructible
atom
has
been
succeeded
by
the
apparently
indestructible
electron
and
the
indestructible
proton
another
fact
to
be
explained
is
the
great
similarity
of
these
practically
indestructible
objects
all
electrons
are
very
similar
to
each
other
we
need
not
outrun
the
evidence
and
say
that
they
are
identical
but
our
powers
of
observation
cannot
detect
any
differences
analogously
all
hydrogen
nuclei
are
alike
also
we
note
the
great
numbers
of
these
analogous
objects
there
are
throngs
of
them
it
seems
as
though
a
certain
similarity
were
a
favourable
condition
for
endurance
common
sense
also
suggests
this
conclusion
if
organisms
are
to
survive
they
must
work
together
accordingly
the
key
to
the
mechanism
of
evolution
is
the
necessity
for
the
evolution
of
a
favourable
environment
conjointly
with
the
evolution
of
any
specific
type
of
enduring
organisms
of
great
permanence
any
physical
object
which
by
its
influence
deteriorates
its
environment
commits
suicide
one
of
the
simplest
ways
of
evolving
a
favourable
environment
concurrently
with
the
development
of
the
individual
organism
is
that
the
influence
of
each
organism
on
the
environment
should
be
favourable
to
the
endurance
of
other
organisms
of
the
same
type
further
if
the
organism
also
favours
the
development
of
other
organisms
of
the
same
type
you
have
then
obtained
a
mechanism
of
evolution
adapted
to
produce
the
observed
state
of
large
multitudes
of
analogous
entities
with
high
powers
of
endurance
for
the
environment
automatically
develops
with
the
species
and
the
species
with
the
environment
the
first
question
to
ask
is
whether
there
is
any
direct
evidence
for
such
a
mechanism
for
the
evolution
of
enduring
organisms
in
surveying
nature
we
must
remember
that
there
are
not
only
basic
organisms
whose
ingredients
are
merely
aspects
of
eternal
objects
there
are
also
organisms
of
organisms
suppose
for
the
moment
and
for
the
sake
of
simplicity
we
assume
without
any
evidence
that
electrons
and
hydrogen
nuclei
are
such
basic
organisms
then
the
atoms
and
the
molecules
are
organisms
of
a
higher
type
which
also
represent
a
compact
definite
organic
unity
but
when
we
come
to
the
larger
aggregations
of
matter
the
organic
unity
fades
into
the
background
it
appears
to
be
but
faint
and
elementary
it
is
there
but
the
pattern
is
vague
and
indecisive
it
is
a
mere
aggregation
of
effects
when
we
come
to
living
beings
the
definiteness
of
pattern
is
recovered
and
the
organic
character
again
rises
into
prominence
accordingly
the
characteristic
laws
of
inorganic
matter
are
mainly
the
statistical
averages
resulting
from
confused
aggregates
so
far
are
they
from
throwing
light
on
the
ultimate
nature
of
things
that
they
blur
and
obliterate
the
individual
characters
of
the
individual
organisms
if
we
wish
to
throw
light
upon
the
facts
relating
to
organisms
we
must
study
either
the
individual
molecules
and
electrons
or
the
individual
living
beings
in
between
we
find
comparative
confusion
now
the
difficulty
of
studying
the
individual
molecule
is
that
we
know
so
little
about
its
life
history
we
cannot
keep
an
individual
under
continuous
observation
in
general
we
deal
with
them
in
large
aggregates
so
far
as
individuals
are
concerned
sometimes
with
difficulty
a
great
experimenter
throws
so
to
speak
a
flash
light
on
one
of
them
and
just
observes
one
type
of
instantaneous
effect
accordingly
the
history
of
the
functioning
of
individual
molecules
or
electrons
is
largely
hidden
from
us
but
in
the
case
of
living
beings
we
can
trace
the
history
of
individuals
we
now
find
exactly
the
mechanism
which
is
here
demanded
in
the
first
place
there
is
the
propagation
of
the
species
from
members
of
the
same
species
there
is
also
the
careful
provision
of
the
favourable
environment
for
the
endurance
of
the
family
the
race
or
the
seed
in
the
fruit
it
is
evident
however
that
i
have
explained
the
evolutionary
mechanism
in
terms
which
are
far
too
simple
we
find
associated
species
of
living
things
providing
for
each
other
a
favourable
environment
thus
just
as
the
members
of
the
same
species
mutually
favour
each
other
so
do
members
of
associated
species
we
find
the
rudimentary
fact
of
association
in
the
existence
of
the
two
species
electrons
and
hydrogen
nuclei
the
simplicity
of
the
dual
association
and
the
apparent
absence
of
competition
from
other
antagonistic
species
accounts
for
the
massive
endurance
which
we
find
among
them
there
are
thus
two
sides
to
the
machinery
involved
in
the
development
of
nature
on
one
side
there
is
a
given
environment
with
organisms
adapting
themselves
to
it
the
scientific
materialism
of
the
epoch
in
question
emphasised
this
aspect
from
this
point
of
view
there
is
a
given
amount
of
material
and
only
a
limited
number
of
organisms
can
take
advantage
of
it
the
givenness
of
the
environment
dominates
everything
accordingly
the
last
words
of
science
appeared
to
be
the
struggle
for
existence
and
natural
selection
darwinâ€™s
own
writings
are
for
all
time
a
model
of
refusal
to
go
beyond
the
direct
evidence
and
of
careful
retention
of
every
possible
hypothesis
but
those
virtues
were
not
so
conspicuous
in
his
followers
and
still
less
in
his
camp-followers
the
imagination
of
european
sociologists
and
publicists
was
stained
by
exclusive
attention
to
this
aspect
of
conflicting
interests
the
idea
prevailed
that
there
was
a
peculiar
strong-minded
realism
in
discarding
ethical
considerations
in
the
determination
of
the
conduct
of
commercial
and
national
interests
the
other
side
of
the
evolutionary
machinery
the
neglected
side
is
expressed
by
the
word
creativeness
the
organisms
can
create
their
own
environment
for
this
purpose
the
single
organism
is
almost
helpless
the
adequate
forces
require
societies
of
coã¶perating
organisms
but
with
such
coã¶peration
and
in
proportion
to
the
effort
put
forward
the
environment
has
a
plasticity
which
alters
the
whole
ethical
aspect
of
evolution
in
the
immediate
past
and
at
present
a
muddled
state
of
mind
is
prevalent
the
increased
plasticity
of
the
environment
for
mankind
resulting
from
the
advances
in
scientific
technology
is
being
construed
in
terms
of
habits
of
thought
which
find
their
justification
in
the
theory
of
a
fixed
environment
the
riddle
of
the
universe
is
not
so
simple
there
is
the
aspect
of
permanence
in
which
a
given
type
of
attainment
is
endlessly
repeated
for
its
own
sake
and
there
is
the
aspect
of
transition
to
other
things,â€”it
may
be
of
higher
worth
and
it
may
be
of
lower
worth
also
there
are
its
aspects
of
struggle
and
of
friendly
help
but
romantic
ruthlessness
is
no
nearer
to
real
politics
than
is
romantic
self-abnegation
chapter
vii
relativity
in
the
previous
lectures
of
this
course
we
have
considered
the
antecedent
conditions
which
led
up
to
the
scientific
movement
and
have
traced
the
progress
of
thought
from
the
seventeenth
to
the
nineteenth
century
in
the
nineteenth
century
this
history
falls
into
three
parts
so
far
as
it
is
to
be
grouped
around
science
these
divisions
are
the
contact
between
the
romantic
movement
and
science
the
development
of
technology
and
physics
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
century
and
lastly
the
theory
of
evolution
combined
with
the
general
advance
of
the
biological
sciences
the
dominating
note
of
the
whole
period
of
three
centuries
is
that
the
doctrine
of
materialism
afforded
an
adequate
basis
for
the
concepts
of
science
it
was
practically
unquestioned
when
undulations
were
wanted
an
ether
was
supplied
in
order
to
perform
the
duties
of
an
undulatory
material
to
show
the
full
assumption
thus
involved
i
have
sketched
in
outline
an
alternative
doctrine
of
an
organic
theory
of
nature
in
the
last
lecture
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
biological
developments
the
doctrine
of
evolution
the
doctrine
of
energy
and
the
molecular
theories
were
rapidly
undermining
the
adequacy
of
the
orthodox
materialism
but
until
the
close
of
the
century
no
one
drew
that
conclusion
materialism
reigned
supreme
the
note
of
the
present
epoch
is
that
so
many
complexities
have
developed
regarding
material
space
time
and
energy
that
the
simple
security
of
the
old
orthodox
assumptions
has
vanished
it
is
obvious
that
they
will
not
do
as
newton
left
them
or
even
as
clerk
maxwell
left
them
there
must
be
a
reorganization
the
new
situation
in
the
thought
of
to-day
arises
from
the
fact
that
scientific
theory
is
outrunning
common
sense
the
settlement
as
inherited
by
the
eighteenth
century
was
a
triumph
of
organised
common
sense
it
had
got
rid
of
medieval
phantasies
and
of
cartesian
vortices
as
a
result
it
gave
full
reign
to
its
anti-rationalistic
tendencies
derived
from
the
historical
revolt
of
the
reformation
period
it
grounded
itself
upon
what
every
plain
man
could
see
with
his
own
eyes
or
with
a
microscope
of
moderate
power
it
measured
the
obvious
things
to
be
measured
and
it
generalised
the
obvious
things
to
be
generalised
for
example
it
generalised
the
ordinary
notions
of
weight
and
massiveness
the
eighteenth
century
opened
with
the
quiet
confidence
that
at
last
nonsense
had
been
got
rid
of
to-day
we
are
at
the
opposite
pole
of
thought
heaven
knows
what
seeming
nonsense
may
not
to-morrow
be
demonstrated
truth
we
have
recaptured
some
of
the
tone
of
the
early
nineteenth
century
only
on
a
higher
imaginative
level
the
reason
why
we
are
on
a
higher
imaginative
level
is
not
because
we
have
finer
imagination
but
because
we
have
better
instruments
in
science
the
most
important
thing
that
has
happened
during
the
last
forty
years
is
the
advance
in
instrumental
design
this
advance
is
partly
due
to
a
few
men
of
genius
such
as
michelson
and
the
german
opticians
it
is
also
due
to
the
progress
of
technological
processes
of
manufacture
particularly
in
the
region
of
metallurgy
the
designer
has
now
at
his
disposal
a
variety
of
material
of
differing
physical
properties
he
can
thus
depend
upon
obtaining
the
material
he
desires
and
it
can
be
ground
to
the
shapes
he
desires
within
very
narrow
limits
of
tolerance
these
instruments
have
put
thought
onto
a
new
level
a
fresh
instrument
serves
the
same
purpose
as
foreign
travel
it
shows
things
in
unusual
combinations
the
gain
is
more
than
a
mere
addition
it
is
a
transformation
the
advance
in
experimental
ingenuity
is
perhaps
also
due
to
the
larger
proportion
of
national
ability
which
now
flows
into
scientific
pursuits
anyhow
whatever
be
the
cause
subtle
and
ingenious
experiments
have
abounded
within
the
last
generation
the
result
is
that
a
great
deal
of
information
has
been
accumulated
in
regions
of
nature
very
far
removed
from
the
ordinary
experience
of
mankind
two
famous
experiments
one
devised
by
galileo
at
the
outset
of
the
scientific
movement
and
the
other
by
michelson
with
the
aid
of
his
famous
interferometer
first
carried
out
in
1881
and
repeated
in
1887
and
1905
illustrate
the
assertions
i
have
made
galileo
dropped
heavy
bodies
from
the
top
of
the
leaning
tower
of
pisa
and
demonstrated
that
bodies
of
different
weights
if
released
simultaneously
would
reach
the
earth
together
so
far
as
experimental
skill
and
delicacy
of
apparatus
were
concerned
this
experiment
could
have
been
made
at
any
time
within
the
preceding
five
thousand
years
the
ideas
involved
merely
concerned
weight
and
speed
of
travel
ideas
which
are
familiar
in
ordinary
life
the
whole
set
of
ideas
might
have
been
familiar
to
the
family
of
king
minos
of
crete
as
they
dropped
pebbles
into
the
sea
from
high
battlements
rising
from
the
shore
we
cannot
too
carefully
realise
that
science
started
with
the
organisation
of
ordinary
experiences
it
was
in
this
way
that
it
coalesced
so
readily
with
the
anti-rationalistic
bias
of
the
historical
revolt
it
was
not
asking
for
ultimate
meanings
it
confined
itself
to
investigating
the
connections
regulating
the
succession
of
obvious
occurrences
michelsonâ€™s
experiment
could
not
have
been
made
earlier
than
it
was
it
required
the
general
advance
in
technology
and
michelsonâ€™s
experimental
genius
it
concerns
the
determination
of
the
earthâ€™s
motion
through
the
ether
and
it
assumes
that
light
consists
of
waves
of
vibration
advancing
at
a
fixed
rate
through
the
ether
in
any
direction
also
of
course
the
earth
is
moving
through
the
ether
and
michelsonâ€™s
apparatus
is
moving
with
the
earth
in
the
centre
of
the
apparatus
a
ray
of
light
is
divided
so
that
one
half-ray
goes
in
one
direction
along
the
apparatus
through
a
given
distance
and
is
reflected
back
to
the
centre
by
a
mirror
in
the
apparatus
the
other
half-ray
goes
the
same
distance
across
the
apparatus
in
a
direction
at
right
angles
to
the
former
ray
and
it
also
is
reflected
back
to
the
centre
these
reunited
rays
are
then
reflected
onto
a
screen
in
the
apparatus
if
precautions
are
taken
you
will
see
interference
bands
namely
bands
of
blackness
where
the
crests
of
the
waves
of
one
ray
have
filled
up
the
troughs
of
the
other
rays
owing
to
a
minute
difference
in
the
lengths
of
paths
of
the
two
half-rays
up
to
certain
parts
of
the
screens
these
differences
in
length
will
be
affected
by
the
motion
of
the
earth
for
it
is
the
lengths
of
the
paths
in
the
ether
which
count
thus
since
the
apparatus
is
moving
with
the
earth
the
path
of
one
half-ray
will
be
disturbed
by
the
motion
in
a
different
manner
from
the
path
of
the
other
half-ray
think
of
yourself
as
moving
in
a
railway
carriage
first
along
the
train
and
then
across
the
train
and
mark
out
your
paths
on
the
railway
track
which
in
this
analogy
corresponds
to
the
ether
now
the
motion
of
the
earth
is
very
slow
compared
to
that
of
light
thus
in
the
analogy
you
must
think
of
the
train
almost
at
a
standstill
and
of
yourself
as
moving
very
quickly
in
the
experiment
this
effect
of
the
earthâ€™s
motion
would
affect
the
positions
on
the
screen
of
the
interference
bands
also
if
you
turn
the
apparatus
round
through
a
right-angle
the
effect
of
the
earthâ€™s
motion
on
the
two
half-rays
will
be
interchanged
and
the
positions
of
the
interference
bands
would
be
shifted
we
can
calculate
the
small
shift
which
should
result
owing
to
the
earthâ€™s
motion
round
the
sun
also
to
this
effect
we
have
to
add
that
due
to
the
sunâ€™s
motion
through
the
ether
the
delicacy
of
the
instrument
can
be
tested
and
it
can
be
proved
that
these
effects
of
shifting
are
large
enough
to
be
observed
by
it
now
the
point
is
that
nothing
was
observed
there
was
no
shifting
as
you
turned
the
instrument
round
the
conclusion
is
either
that
the
earth
is
always
stationary
in
the
ether
or
that
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
fundamental
principles
on
which
the
interpretation
of
the
experiment
relies
it
is
obvious
that
in
this
experiment
we
are
very
far
away
from
the
thoughts
and
the
games
of
the
children
of
king
minos
the
ideas
of
an
ether
of
waves
in
it
of
interference
of
the
motion
of
the
earth
through
the
ether
and
of
michelsonâ€™s
interferometer
are
remote
from
ordinary
experience
but
remote
as
they
are
they
are
simple
and
obvious
compared
to
the
accepted
explanation
of
the
nugatory
result
of
the
experiment
the
ground
of
the
explanation
is
that
the
ideas
of
space
and
of
time
employed
in
science
are
too
simple-minded
and
must
be
modified
this
conclusion
is
a
direct
challenge
to
common
sense
because
the
earlier
science
had
only
refined
upon
the
ordinary
notions
of
ordinary
people
such
a
radical
reorganization
of
ideas
would
not
have
been
adopted
unless
it
had
also
been
supported
by
many
other
observations
which
we
need
not
enter
upon
some
form
of
the
relativity
theory
seems
to
be
the
simplest
way
of
explaining
a
large
number
of
facts
which
otherwise
would
each
require
some
ad
hoc
explanation
the
theory
therefore
does
not
merely
depend
upon
the
experiments
which
led
to
its
origination
the
central
point
of
the
explanation
is
that
every
instrument
such
as
michelsonâ€™s
apparatus
as
used
in
the
experiment
necessarily
records
the
velocity
of
light
as
having
one
and
the
same
definite
speed
relatively
to
it
i
mean
that
an
interferometer
in
a
comet
and
an
interferometer
on
the
earth
would
necessarily
bring
out
the
velocity
of
light
relatively
to
themselves
as
at
the
same
value
this
is
an
obvious
paradox
since
the
light
moves
with
a
definite
velocity
through
the
ether
accordingly
two
bodies
the
earth
and
the
comet
moving
with
unequal
velocities
through
the
ether
might
be
expected
to
have
different
velocities
relatively
to
rays
of
light
for
example
consider
two
cars
on
a
road
moving
at
ten
and
twenty
miles
an
hour
respectively
and
being
passed
by
another
car
at
fifty
miles
an
hour
the
rapid
car
will
pass
one
of
the
two
cars
at
the
relative
velocity
of
forty
miles
per
hour
and
the
other
at
the
rate
of
thirty
miles
per
hour
the
allegation
as
to
light
is
that
if
we
substituted
a
ray
of
light
for
the
rapid
car
the
velocity
of
the
light
along
the
roadway
would
be
exactly
the
same
as
its
velocity
relatively
to
either
of
the
two
cars
which
it
overtakes
the
velocity
of
light
is
immensely
large
being
about
three
hundred
thousand
kilometres
per
second
we
must
have
notions
as
to
space
and
time
such
that
just
this
velocity
has
this
peculiar
character
it
follows
that
all
our
notions
of
relative
velocity
must
be
recast
but
these
notions
are
the
immediate
outcome
of
our
habitual
notions
as
to
space
and
time
so
we
come
back
to
the
position
that
there
has
been
something
overlooked
in
the
current
expositions
of
what
we
mean
by
space
and
of
what
we
mean
by
time
now
our
habitual
fundamental
assumption
is
that
there
is
a
unique
meaning
to
be
given
to
space
and
a
unique
meaning
to
be
given
to
time
so
that
whatever
meaning
is
given
to
spatial
relations
in
respect
to
the
instrument
on
the
earth
the
same
meaning
must
be
given
to
them
in
respect
to
the
instrument
on
the
comet
and
the
same
meaning
for
an
instrument
at
rest
in
the
ether
in
the
theory
of
relativity
this
is
denied
as
far
as
concerns
space
there
is
no
difficulty
in
agreeing
if
you
think
of
the
obvious
facts
of
relative
motion
but
even
here
the
change
in
meaning
has
to
go
further
than
would
be
sanctioned
by
common
sense
also
the
same
demand
is
made
for
time
so
that
the
relative
dating
of
events
and
the
lapses
of
time
between
them
are
to
be
reckoned
as
different
for
the
instrument
on
the
earth
for
the
instrument
in
the
comet
and
for
the
instrument
at
rest
in
the
ether
this
is
a
greater
strain
on
our
credulity
we
need
not
probe
the
question
further
than
the
conclusion
that
for
the
earth
and
for
the
comet
spatiality
and
temporality
are
each
to
have
different
meanings
amid
different
conditions
such
as
those
presented
by
the
earth
and
the
comet
accordingly
velocity
has
different
meanings
for
the
two
bodies
thus
the
modern
scientific
assumption
is
that
if
anything
has
the
speed
of
light
by
reference
to
any
one
meaning
of
space
and
time
then
it
has
the
same
speed
according
to
any
other
meaning
of
space
and
time
this
is
a
heavy
blow
at
the
classical
scientific
materialism
which
presupposes
a
definite
present
instant
at
which
all
matter
is
simultaneously
real
in
the
modern
theory
there
is
no
such
unique
present
instant
you
can
find
a
meaning
for
the
notion
of
the
simultaneous
instant
throughout
all
nature
but
it
will
be
a
different
meaning
for
different
notions
of
temporality
there
has
been
a
tendency
to
give
an
extreme
subjectivist
interpretation
to
this
new
doctrine
i
mean
that
the
relativity
of
space
and
time
has
been
construed
as
though
it
were
dependent
on
the
choice
of
the
observer
it
is
perfectly
legitimate
to
bring
in
the
observer
if
he
facilitates
explanations
but
it
is
the
observerâ€™s
body
that
we
want
and
not
his
mind
even
this
body
is
only
useful
as
an
example
of
a
very
familiar
form
of
apparatus
on
the
whole
it
is
better
to
concentrate
attention
on
michelsonâ€™s
interferometer
and
to
leave
michelsonâ€™s
body
and
michelsonâ€™s
mind
out
of
the
picture
the
question
is
why
did
the
interferometer
have
black
bands
on
its
screen
and
why
did
not
these
bands
slightly
shift
as
the
instrument
turned
the
new
relativity
associates
space
and
time
with
an
intimacy
not
hitherto
contemplated
and
presupposes
that
their
separation
in
concrete
fact
can
be
achieved
by
alternative
modes
of
abstraction
yielding
alternative
meanings
but
each
mode
of
abstraction
is
directing
attention
to
something
which
is
in
nature
and
thereby
is
isolating
it
for
the
purpose
of
contemplation
the
fact
relevant
to
experiment
is
the
relevance
of
the
interferometer
to
just
one
among
the
many
alternative
systems
of
these
spatio-temporal
relations
which
hold
between
natural
entities
what
we
must
now
ask
of
philosophy
is
to
give
us
an
interpretation
of
the
status
in
nature
of
space
and
time
so
that
the
possibility
of
alternative
meanings
is
preserved
these
lectures
are
not
suited
for
the
elaboration
of
details
but
there
is
no
difficulty
in
pointing
out
where
to
look
for
the
origin
of
the
discrimination
between
space
and
time
i
am
presupposing
the
organic
theory
of
nature
which
i
have
outlined
as
a
basis
for
a
thoroughgoing
objectivism
an
event
is
the
grasping
into
unity
of
a
pattern
of
aspects
the
effectiveness
of
an
event
beyond
itself
arises
from
the
aspects
of
itself
which
go
to
form
the
prehended
unities
of
other
events
except
for
the
systematic
aspects
of
geometrical
shape
this
effectiveness
is
trivial
if
the
mirrored
pattern
attaches
merely
to
the
event
as
one
whole
if
the
pattern
endures
throughout
the
successive
parts
of
the
event
and
also
exhibits
itself
in
the
whole
so
that
the
event
is
the
life
history
of
the
pattern
then
in
virtue
of
that
enduring
pattern
the
event
gains
in
external
effectiveness
for
its
own
effectiveness
is
reã«nforced
by
the
analogous
aspects
of
all
its
successive
parts
the
event
constitutes
a
patterned
value
with
a
permanence
inherent
throughout
its
own
parts
and
by
reason
of
this
inherent
endurance
the
event
is
important
for
the
modification
of
its
environment
it
is
in
this
endurance
of
pattern
that
time
differentiates
itself
from
space
the
pattern
is
spatially
now
and
this
temporal
determination
constitutes
its
relation
to
each
partial
event
for
it
is
reproduced
in
this
temporal
succession
of
these
spatial
parts
of
its
own
life
i
mean
that
this
particular
rule
of
temporal
order
allows
the
pattern
to
be
reproduced
in
each
temporal
slice
of
its
history
so
to
speak
each
enduring
object
discovers
in
nature
and
requires
from
nature
a
principle
discriminating
space
from
time
apart
from
the
fact
of
an
enduring
pattern
this
principle
might
be
there
but
it
would
be
latent
and
trivial
thus
the
importance
of
space
as
against
time
and
of
time
as
against
space
has
developed
with
the
development
of
enduring
organisms
enduring
objects
are
significant
of
a
differentiation
of
space
from
time
in
respect
to
the
patterns
ingredient
within
events
and
conversely
the
differentiation
of
space
from
time
in
the
patterns
ingredient
within
events
expresses
the
patience
of
the
community
of
events
for
enduring
objects
there
might
be
the
community
without
objects
but
there
could
not
be
the
enduring
objects
without
the
community
with
its
peculiar
patience
for
them
it
is
very
necessary
that
this
point
should
not
be
misunderstood
endurance
means
that
a
pattern
which
is
exhibited
in
the
prehension
of
one
event
is
also
exhibited
in
the
prehension
of
those
of
its
parts
which
are
discriminated
by
a
certain
rule
it
is
not
true
that
any
part
of
the
whole
event
will
yield
the
same
pattern
as
does
the
whole
for
example
consider
the
total
bodily
pattern
exhibited
in
the
life
of
a
human
body
during
one
minute
one
of
the
thumbs
during
the
same
minute
is
part
of
the
whole
bodily
event
but
the
pattern
of
this
part
is
the
pattern
of
the
thumb
and
is
not
the
pattern
of
the
whole
body
thus
endurance
requires
a
definite
rule
for
obtaining
the
parts
in
the
above
example
we
know
at
once
what
the
rule
is:
you
must
take
the
life
of
the
whole
body
during
any
portion
of
that
same
minute
for
example
during
a
second
or
a
tenth
of
a
second
in
other
words
the
meaning
of
endurance
presupposes
a
meaning
for
the
lapse
of
time
within
the
spatio-temporal
continuum
the
question
now
arises
whether
all
enduring
objects
discover
the
same
principle
of
differentiation
of
space
from
time
or
even
whether
at
different
stages
of
its
own
life-history
one
object
may
not
vary
in
its
spatio-temporal
discrimination
up
till
a
few
years
ago
everyone
unhesitatingly
assumed
that
there
was
only
one
such
principle
to
be
discovered
accordingly
in
dealing
with
one
object
time
would
have
exactly
the
same
meaning
in
reference
to
endurance
as
in
dealing
with
the
endurance
of
another
object
it
would
also
follow
then
that
spatial
relations
would
have
one
unique
meaning
but
now
it
seems
that
the
observed
effectiveness
of
objects
can
only
be
explained
by
assuming
that
objects
in
a
state
of
motion
relatively
to
each
other
are
utilising
for
their
endurance
meanings
of
space
and
of
time
which
are
not
identical
from
one
object
to
another
every
enduring
object
is
to
be
conceived
as
at
rest
in
its
own
proper
space
and
in
motion
throughout
any
space
defined
in
a
way
which
is
not
that
inherent
in
its
peculiar
endurance
if
two
objects
are
mutually
at
rest
they
are
utilising
the
same
meanings
of
space
and
of
time
for
the
purposes
of
expressing
their
endurance
if
in
relative
motion
the
spaces
and
times
differ
it
follows
that
if
we
can
conceive
a
body
at
one
stage
of
its
life
history
as
in
motion
relatively
to
itself
at
another
stage
then
the
body
at
these
two
stages
is
utilising
diverse
meanings
of
space
and
correlatively
diverse
meanings
of
time
in
an
organic
philosophy
of
nature
there
is
nothing
to
decide
between
the
old
hypothesis
of
the
uniqueness
of
the
time
discrimination
and
the
new
hypothesis
of
its
multiplicity
it
is
purely
a
matter
for
evidence
drawn
from
observations.[5

in

lecture
i
said
that
an
event
had
contemporaries
it
is
an
interesting
question
whether
on
the
new
hypothesis
such
a
statement
can
be
made
without
the
qualification
of
a
reference
to
a
definite
space-time
system
it
is
possible
to
do
so
in
the
sense
that
in
some
time-system
or
other
the
two
events
are
simultaneous
in
other
time-systems
the
two
contemporary
events
will
not
be
simultaneous
though
they
may
overlap
analogously
one
event
will
precede
another
without
qualification
if
in
every
time-system
this
precedence
occurs
it
is
evident
that
if
we
start
from
a
given
event
a
other
events
in
general
are
divided
into
two
sets
namely
those
which
without
qualification
are
contemporaneous
with
a
and
those
which
either
precede
or
succeed
a
but
there
will
be
a
set
left
over
namely
those
events
which
bound
the
two
sets
there
we
have
a
critical
case
you
will
remember
that
we
have
a
critical
velocity
to
account
for
namely
the
theoretical
velocity
of
light
in
vacuo_.[6
also
you
will
remember
that
the
utilisation
of
different
spatio-temporal
systems
means
the
relative
motion
of
objects
when
we
analyse
this
critical
relation
of
a
special
set
of
events
to
any
given
event
a
we
find
the
explanation
of
the
critical
velocity
which
we
require
i
am
suppressing
all
details
it
is
evident
that
exactness
of
statement
must
be
introduced
by
the
introduction
of
points
and
lines
and
instants
also
that
the
origin
of
geometry
requires
discussion
for
example
the
measurement
of
lengths
the
straightness
of
lines
and
the
flatness
of
planes
and
perpendicularity
i
have
endeavoured
to
carry
out
these
investigations
in
some
earlier
books
under
the
heading
of
the
theory
of
extensive
abstraction
but
they
are
too
technical
for
the
present
occasion
footnote

this
is
not
the
velocity
of
light
in
a
gravitational
field
or
in
a
medium
of
molecules
and
electrons
if
there
be
no
one
definite
meaning
to
the
geometrical
relations
of
distance
it
is
evident
that
the
law
of
gravitation
needs
restatement
for
the
formula
expressing
that
law
is
that
two
particles
attract
each
other
in
proportion
to
the
product
of
their
masses
and
the
inverse
square
of
their
distances
this
enunciation
tacitly
assumes
that
there
is
one
definite
meaning
to
be
ascribed
to
the
instant
at
which
the
attraction
is
considered
and
also
one
definite
meaning
to
be
ascribed
to
distance
but
distance
is
a
purely
spatial
notion
so
that
in
the
new
doctrine
there
are
an
indefinite
number
of
such
meanings
according
to
the
space-time
system
which
you
adopt
if
the
two
particles
are
relatively
at
rest
then
we
might
be
content
with
the
space-time
systems
which
they
are
both
utilising
unfortunately
this
suggestion
gives
no
hint
as
to
procedure
when
they
are
not
mutually
at
rest
it
is
therefore
necessary
to
reformulate
the
law
in
a
way
which
does
not
presuppose
any
particular
space-time
system
einstein
has
done
this
naturally
the
result
is
more
complicated
he
introduced
into
mathematical
physics
certain
methods
of
pure
mathematics
which
render
the
formulae
independent
of
the
particular
systems
of
measurement
adopted
the
new
formula
introduces
various
small
effects
which
are
absent
in
newtonâ€™s
law
but
for
the
major
effects
newtonâ€™s
law
and
einsteinâ€™s
law
agree
now
these
extra
effects
of
einsteinâ€™s
law
serve
to
explain
irregularities
of
the
planet
mercuryâ€™s
orbit
which
by
newtonâ€™s
law
were
inexplicable
this
is
a
strong
confirmation
of
the
new
theory
curiously
enough
there
is
more
than
one
alternative
formula
based
on
the
new
theory
of
multiple
space-time
systems
having
the
property
of
embodying
newtonâ€™s
law
and
in
addition
of
explaining
the
peculiarities
of
mercuryâ€™s
motion
the
only
method
of
selection
between
them
is
to
wait
for
experimental
evidence
respecting
those
effects
on
which
the
formulae
differ
nature
is
probably
quite
indifferent
to
the
aesthetic
preferences
of
mathematicians
it
only
remains
to
add
that
einstein
would
probably
reject
the
theory
of
multiple
space-time
systems
which
i
have
been
expounding
to
you
he
would
interpret
his
formula
in
terms
of
contortions
in
space-time
which
alter
the
invariance
theory
for
measure
properties
and
of
the
proper
times
of
each
historical
route
his
mode
of
statement
has
the
greater
mathematical
simplicity
and
only
allows
of
one
law
of
gravitation
excluding
the
alternatives
but
for
myself
i
cannot
reconcile
it
with
the
given
facts
of
our
experience
as
to
simultaneity
and
spatial
arrangement
there
are
also
other
difficulties
of
a
more
abstract
character
the
theory
of
the
relationship
between
events
at
which
we
have
now
arrived
is
based
first
upon
the
doctrine
that
the
relatednesses
of
an
event
are
all
internal
relations
so
far
as
concerns
that
event
though
not
necessarily
so
far
as
concerns
the
other
relata
for
example
the
eternal
objects
thus
involved
are
externally
related
to
events
this
internal
relatedness
is
the
reason
why
an
event
can
be
found
only
just
where
it
is
and
how
it
is,â€”that
is
to
say
in
just
one
definite
set
of
relationships
for
each
relationship
enters
into
the
essence
of
the
event
so
that
apart
from
that
relationship
the
event
would
not
be
itself
this
is
what
is
meant
by
the
very
notion
of
internal
relations
it
has
been
usual
indeed
universal
to
hold
that
spatio-temporal
relationships
are
external
this
doctrine
is
what
is
here
denied
the
conception
of
internal
relatedness
involves
the
analysis
of
the
event
into
two
factors
one
the
underlying
substantial
activity
of
individualisation
and
the
other
the
complex
of
aspectsâ€”that
is
to
say
the
complex
of
relatednesses
as
entering
into
the
essence
of
the
given
eventâ€”which
are
unified
by
this
individualised
activity
in
other
words
the
concept
of
internal
relations
requires
the
concept
of
substance
as
the
activity
synthesising
the
relationships
into
its
emergent
character
the
event
is
what
it
is
by
reason
of
the
unification
in
itself
of
a
multiplicity
of
relationships
the
general
scheme
of
these
mutual
relationships
is
an
abstraction
which
presupposes
each
event
as
an
independent
entity
which
it
is
not
and
asks
what
remnant
of
these
formative
relationships
is
then
left
in
the
guise
of
external
relationships
the
scheme
of
relationships
as
thus
impartially
expressed
becomes
the
scheme
of
a
complex
of
events
variously
related
as
wholes
to
parts
and
as
joint
parts
within
some
one
whole
even
here
the
internal
relationship
forces
itself
on
our
attention
for
the
part
evidently
is
constitutive
of
the
whole
also
an
isolated
event
which
has
lost
its
status
in
any
complex
of
events
is
equally
excluded
by
the
very
nature
of
an
event
so
the
whole
is
evidently
constitutive
of
the
part
thus
the
internal
character
of
the
relationship
really
shows
through
this
impartial
scheme
of
abstract
external
relations
but
this
exhibition
of
the
actual
universe
as
extensive
and
divisible
has
left
out
the
distinction
between
space
and
time
it
has
in
fact
left
out
the
process
of
realisation
which
is
the
adjustment
of
the
synthetic
activities
by
virtue
of
which
the
various
events
become
their
realised
selves
this
adjustment
is
thus
the
adjustment
of
the
underlying
active
substances
whereby
these
substances
exhibit
themselves
as
the
individualisations
or
modes
of
spinozaâ€™s
one
substance
this
adjustment
is
what
introduces
temporal
process
thus
in
some
sense
time
in
its
character
of
the
adjustment
of
the
process
of
synthetic
realisation
extends
beyond
the
spatio-temporal
continuum
of
nature.[7
there
is
no
necessity
that
temporal
process
in
this
sense
should
be
constituted
by
one
single
series
of
linear
succession
accordingly
in
order
to
satisfy
the
present
demands
of
scientific
hypothesis
we
introduce
the
metaphysical
hypothesis
that
this
is
not
the
case
we
do
assume
basing
ourselves
upon
direct
observation
however
that
temporal
process
of
realisation
can
be
analysed
into
a
group
of
linear
serial
processes
each
of
these
linear
series
is
a
space-time
system
in
support
of
this
assumption
of
definite
serial
processes
we
appeal:
1
to
the
immediate
presentation
through
the
senses
of
an
extended
universe
beyond
ourselves
and
simultaneous
with
ourselves
2
to
the
intellectual
apprehension
of
a
meaning
to
the
question
which
asks
what
is
now
immediately
happening
in
regions
beyond
the
cognisance
of
our
senses
3
to
the
analysis
of
what
is
involved
in
the
endurance
of
emergent
objects
this
endurance
of
objects
involves
the
display
of
a
pattern
as
now
realised
this
display
is
the
display
of
a
pattern
as
inherent
in
an
event
but
also
as
exhibiting
a
temporal
slice
of
nature
as
lending
aspects
to
eternal
objects
or
equally
of
eternal
objects
as
lending
aspects
to
events
the
pattern
is
spatialised
in
a
whole
duration
for
the
benefit
of
the
event
into
whose
essence
the
pattern
enters
the
event
is
part
of
the
duration
i.e
is
part
of
what
is
exhibited
in
the
aspects
inherent
in
itself
and
conversely
the
duration
is
the
whole
of
nature
simultaneous
with
the
event
in
that
sense
of
simultaneity
thus
an
event
in
realising
itself
displays
a
pattern
and
this
pattern
requires
a
definite
duration
determined
by
a
definite
meaning
of
simultaneity
each
such
meaning
of
simultaneity
relates
the
pattern
as
thus
displayed
to
one
definite
space-time
system
the
actuality
of
the
space-time
systems
is
constituted
by
the
realisation
of
pattern
but
it
is
inherent
in
the
general
scheme
of
events
as
constituting
its
patience
for
the
temporal
process
of
realisation

notice
that
the
pattern
requires
a
duration
involving
a
definite
lapse
of
time
and
not
merely
an
instantaneous
moment
such
a
moment
is
more
abstract
in
that
it
merely
denotes
a
certain
relation
of
contiguity
between
the
concrete
events
thus
a
duration
is
spatialised
and
by
â€˜spatialisedâ€™
is
meant
that
the
duration
is
the
field
for
the
realised
pattern
constituting
the
character
of
the
event
a
duration
as
the
field
of
the
pattern
realised
in
the
actualisation
of
one
of
its
contained
events
is
an
epoch
i.e
an
arrest
endurance
is
the
repetition
of
the
pattern
in
successive
events
thus
endurance
requires
a
succession
of
durations
each
exhibiting
the
pattern
in
this
account
â€˜timeâ€™
has
been
separated
from
â€˜extensionâ€™
and
from
the
â€˜divisibilityâ€™
which
arises
from
the
character
of
spatio-temporal
extensionâ€™
accordingly
we
must
not
proceed
to
conceive
time
as
another
form
of
extensiveness
time
is
sheer
succession
of
epochal
durations
but
the
entities
which
succeed
each
other
in
this
account
are
durations
the
duration
is
that
which
is
required
for
the
realisation
of
a
pattern
in
the
given
event
thus
the
divisibility
and
extensiveness
is
within
the
given
duration
the
epochal
duration
is
not
realised
via
its
successive
divisible
parts
but
is
given
with
its
parts

this
way

zeno

to
the

validity
of
two

critique
of

is
met
by
abandoning
the

of

considerations
respecting
quantity
in
general
extensive

intensive
are
summed
up
the
earlier
passage
runs
thus:[8

the

runs
thus:
â€œthis

called

time

because
there
is
no

that
is
not

no

be

before
space

never

compounded
into

i
am
in
complete
agreement
with
the
second
extract
if
â€˜time
and
spaceâ€™
is
the
extensive
continuum
but
it
is
inconsistent
with
its
predecessor
for
zeno
would
object
that
a
vicious
infinite
regress
is
involved
every
part
of
time
involves
some
smaller
part
of
itself
and
so
on
also
this
series
regresses
backwards
ultimately
to
nothing
since
the
initial
moment
is
without
duration
and
merely
marks
the
relation
of
contiguity
to
an
earlier
time
thus
time
is
impossible
if
the
two
extracts
are
both
adhered
to
i
accept
the
later
and
reject
the
earlier
passage
realisation
is
the
becoming
of
time
in
the
field
of
extension
extension
is
the
complex
of
events
quã¢
their
potentialities
in
realisation
the
potentiality
becomes
actuality
but
the
potential
pattern
requires
a
duration
and
the
duration
must
be
exhibited
as
an
epochal
whole
by
the
realisation
of
the
pattern
thus
time
is
the
succession
of
elements
in
themselves
divisible
and
contiguous
a
duration
in
becoming
temporal
thereby
incurs
realisation
in
respect
to
some
enduring
object
temporalisation
is
realisation
temporalisation
is
not
another
continuous
process
it
is
an
atomic
succession
thus
time
is
atomic
i.e
epochal
though
what
is
temporalised
is
divisible
this
doctrine
follows
from
the
doctrine
of
events
and
of
the
nature
of
enduring
objects
in
the
next
chapter
we
must
consider
its
relevance
to
the
quantum
theory
of
recent
science
it
is
to
be
noted
that
this
doctrine
of
the
epochal
character
of
time
does
not
depend
on
the
modern
doctrine
of
relativity
and
holds
equallyâ€”and
indeed
more
simplyâ€”if
this
doctrine
be
abandoned
it
does
depend
on
the
analysis
of
the
intrinsic
character
of
an
event
considered
as
the
most
concrete
finite
entity
in
reviewing
this
argument
note
first
that
the
second
quotation
from
kant
on
which
it
is
based
does
not
depend
on
any
peculiar
kantian
doctrine
the
latter
of
the
two
is
in
agreement
with
plato
as
against
aristotle.[10
in
the
second
place
the
argument
assumes
that
zeno
understated
his
argument
he
should
have
urged
it
against
the
current
notion
of
time
in
itself
and
not
against
motion
which
involves
relations
between
time
and
space
for
what
becomes
has
duration
but
no
duration
can
become
until
a
smaller
duration
part
of
the
former
has
antecedently
come
into
being
kantâ€™s
earlier
statement
the
same
argument
applies
to
this
smaller
duration
and
so
on
also
the
infinite
regress
of
these
durations
converges
to
nothingâ€”and
even
on
the
aristotelian
view
there
is
no
first
moment
accordingly
time
would
be
an
irrational
notion
thirdly
in
the
epochal
theory
zenoâ€™s
difficulty
is
met
by
conceiving
temporalisation
as
the
realisation
of
a
complete
organism
this
organism
is
an
event
holding
in
its
essence
its
spatio-temporal
relationships
both
within
itself
and
beyond
itself
throughout
the
spatio-temporal
continuum

the
quantum
theory
the
theory
of
relativity
has
justly
excited
a
great
amount
of
public
attention
but
for
all
its
importance
it
has
not
been
the
topic
which
has
chiefly
absorbed
the
recent
interest
of
physicists
without
question
that
position
is
held
by
the
quantum
theory
the
point
of
interest
in
this
theory
is
that
according
to
it
some
effects
which
appear
essentially
capable
of
gradual
increase
or
gradual
diminution
are
in
reality
to
be
increased
or
decreased
only
by
certain
definite
jumps
it
is
as
though
you
could
walk
at
three
miles
per
hour
or
at
four
miles
per
hour
but
not
at
three
and
a
half
miles
per
hour
the
effects
in
question
are
concerned
with
the
radiation
of
light
from
a
molecule
which
has
been
excited
by
some
collision
light
consists
of
waves
of
vibration
in
the
electromagnetic
field
after
a
complete
wave
has
passed
a
given
point
everything
at
that
point
is
restored
to
its
original
state
and
is
ready
for
the
next
wave
which
follows
on
picture
to
yourselves
the
waves
on
the
ocean
and
reckon
from
crest
to
crest
of
successive
waves
the
number
of
waves
which
pass
a
given
point
in
one
second
is
called
the
frequency
of
that
system
of
waves
a
system
of
light-waves
of
definite
frequency
corresponds
to
a
definite
colour
in
the
spectrum
now
a
molecule
when
excited
vibrates
with
a
certain
number
of
definite
frequencies
in
other
words
there
are
a
definite
set
of
modes
of
vibration
of
the
molecule
and
each
mode
of
vibration
has
one
definite
frequency
each
mode
of
vibration
can
stir
up
in
the
electromagnetic
field
waves
of
its
own
frequency
these
waves
carry
away
the
energy
of
the
vibration
so
that
finally
when
such
waves
are
in
being
the
molecule
loses
the
energy
of
its
excitement
and
the
waves
cease
thus
a
molecule
can
radiate
light
of
certain
definite
colours
that
is
to
say
of
certain
definite
frequencies
you
would
think
that
each
mode
of
vibration
could
be
excited
to
any
intensity
so
that
the
energy
carried
away
by
light
of
that
frequency
could
be
of
any
amount
but
this
is
not
the
case
there
appear
to
be
certain
minimum
amounts
of
energy
which
cannot
be
subdivided
the
case
is
analogous
to
that
of
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
who
in
paying
his
debts
in
the
currency
of
his
country
cannot
subdivide
a
cent
so
as
to
correspond
to
some
minute
subdivision
of
the
goods
obtained
the
cent
corresponds
to
the
minimum
quantity
of
the
light
energy
and
the
goods
obtained
correspond
to
the
energy
of
the
exciting
cause
this
exciting
cause
is
either
strong
enough
to
procure
the
emission
of
one
cent
of
energy
or
fails
to
procure
the
emission
of
any
energy
whatsoever
in
any
case
the
molecule
will
only
emit
an
integral
number
of
cents
of
energy
there
is
a
further
peculiarity
which
we
can
illustrate
by
bringing
an
englishman
onto
the
scene
he
pays
his
debts
in
english
currency
and
his
smallest
unit
is
a
farthing
which
differs
in
value
from
the
cent
the
farthing
is
in
fact
about
half
a
cent
to
a
very
rough
approximation
in
the
molecule
different
modes
of
vibration
have
different
frequencies
compare
each
mode
to
a
nation
one
mode
corresponds
to
the
united
states
and
another
mode
corresponds
to
england
one
mode
can
only
radiate
its
energy
in
an
integral
number
of
cents
so
that
a
cent
of
energy
is
the
least
it
can
pay
out
whereas
the
other
mode
can
only
radiate
its
energy
in
an
integral
number
of
farthings
so
that
a
farthing
of
energy
is
the
least
that
it
can
pay
out
also
a
rule
can
be
found
to
tell
us
the
relative
value
of
the
cent
of
energy
of
one
mode
to
the
farthing
of
energy
of
another
mode
the
rule
is
childishly
simple:
each
smallest
coin
of
energy
has
a
value
in
strict
proportion
to
the
frequency
belonging
to
that
mode
by
this
rule
and
comparing
farthings
with
cents
the
frequency
of
an
american
would
be
about
twice
that
of
an
englishman
in
other
words
the
american
would
do
about
twice
as
many
things
in
a
second
as
an
englishman
i
must
leave
you
to
judge
whether
this
corresponds
to
the
reputed
characters
of
the
two
nations
also
i
suggest
that
there
are
merits
attaching
to
both
ends
of
the
solar
spectrum
sometimes
you
want
red
light
and
sometimes

light
there
has
been
i
hope
no
great
difficulty
in
comprehending
what
the
quantum
theory
asserts
about
molecules
the
perplexity
arises
from
the
effort
to
fit
the
theory
into
the
current
scientific
picture
of
what
is
going
on
in
the
molecule
or
atom
it
has
been
the
basis
of
the
materialistic
theory
that
the
happenings
of
nature
are
to
be
explained
in
terms
of
the
locomotion
of
material
in
accordance
with
this
principle
the
waves
of
light
were
explained
in
terms
of
the
locomotion
of
a
material
ether
and
the
internal
happenings
of
a
molecule
are
now
explained
in
terms
of
the
locomotion
of
separate
material
parts
in
respect
to
waves
of
light
the
material
ether
has
retreated
to
an
indeterminate
position
in
the
background
and
is
rarely
talked
about
but
the
principle
is
unquestioned
as
regards
its
application
to
the
atom
for
example
a
neutral
hydrogen
atom
is
assumed
to
consist
of
at
least
two
lumps
of
material
one
lump
is
the
nucleus
consisting
of
a
material
called
positive
electricity
and
the
other
is
a
single
electron
which
is
negative
electricity
the
nucleus
shows
signs
of
being
complex
and
of
being
subdivisible
into
smaller
lumps
some
of
positive
electricity
and
others
electronic
the
assumption
is
that
whatever
vibration
takes
place
in
the
atom
is
to
be
attributed
to
the
vibratory
locomotion
of
some
bit
of
material
detachable
from
the
remainder
the
difficulty
with
the
quantum
theory
is
that
on
this
hypothesis
we
have
to
picture
the
atom
as
providing
a
limited
number
of
definite
grooves
which
are
the
sole
tracks
along
which
vibration
can
take
place
whereas
the
classical
scientific
picture
provides
none
of
these
grooves
the
quantum
theory
wants
trolley-cars
with
a
limited
number
of
routes
and
the
scientific
picture
provides
horses
galloping
over
prairies
the
result
is
that
the
physical
doctrine
of
the
atom
has
got
into
a
state
which
is
strongly
suggestive
of
the
epicycles
of
astronomy
before
copernicus
on
the
organic
theory
of
nature
there
are
two
sorts
of
vibrations
which
radically
differ
from
each
other
there
is
vibratory
locomotion
and
there
is
vibratory
organic
deformation
and
the
conditions
for
the
two
types
of
change
are
of
a
different
character
in
other
words
there
is
vibratory
locomotion
of
a
given
pattern
as
one
whole
and
there
is
vibratory
change
of
pattern
a
complete
organism
in
the
organic
theory
is
what
corresponds
to
a
bit
of
material
on
the
materialistic
theory
there
will
be
a
primary
genus
comprising
a
number
of
species
of
organisms
such
that
each
primary
organism
belonging
to
a
species
of
the
primary
genus
is
not
decomposable
into
subordinate
organisms
i
will
call
any
organism
of
the
primary
genus
a
primate
there
may
be
different
species
of
primates
it
must
be
kept
in
mind
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
abstractions
of
physics
accordingly
we
are
not
thinking
of
what
a
primate
is
in
itself
as
a
pattern
arising
from
the
prehension
of
the
concrete
aspects
nor
are
we
thinking
of
what
a
primate
is
for
its
environment
in
respect
to
its
concrete
aspects
prehended
therein
we
are
thinking
of
these
various
aspects
merely
in
so
far
as
their
effects
on
patterns
and
on
locomotion
are
expressible
in
spatio-temporal
terms
accordingly
in
the
language
of
physics
the
aspects
of
a
primate
are
merely
its
contributions
to
the
electromagnetic
field
this
is
in
fact
exactly
what
we
know
of
electrons
and
protons
an
electron
for
us
is
merely
the
pattern
of
its
aspects
in
its
environment
so
far
as
those
aspects
are
relevant
to
the
electromagnetic
field
now
in
discussing
the
theory
of
relativity
we
saw
that
the
relative
motion
of
two
primates
means
simply
that
their
organic
patterns
are
utilising
diverse
space-time
systems
if
two
primates
do
not
continue
either
mutually
at
rest
or
mutually
in
uniform
relative
motion
at
least
one
of
them
is
changing
its
intrinsic
space-time
system
the
laws
of
motion
express
the
conditions
under
which
these
changes
of
space-time
systems
are
effected
the
conditions
for
vibratory
locomotion
are
founded
upon
these
general
laws
of
motion
but
it
is
possible
that
certain
species
of
primates
are
apt
to
go
to
pieces
under
conditions
which
lead
them
to
effect
changes
of
space-time
systems
such
species
would
only
experience
a
long
range
of
endurance
if
they
had
succeeded
in
forming
a
favourable
association
among
primates
of
different
species
such
that
in
this
association
the
tendency
to
collapse
is
neutralised
by
the
environment
of
the
association
we
can
imagine
the
atomic
nucleus
as
composed
of
a
large
number
of
primates
of
differing
species
and
perhaps
with
many
primates
of
the
same
species
the
whole
association
being
such
as
to
favour
stability
an
example
of
such
an
association
is
afforded
by
the
association
of
a
positive
nucleus
with
negative
electrons
to
obtain
a
neutral
atom
the
neutral
atom
is
thereby
shielded
from
any
electric
field
which
would
otherwise
produce
changes
in
the
space-time
system
of
the
atom
the
requirements
of
physics
now
suggest
an
idea
which
is
very
consonant
with
the
organic
philosophical
theory
i
put
it
in
the
form
of
a
question:
has
our
organic
theory
of
endurance
been
tainted
by
the
materialistic
theory
in
so
far
as
it
assumes
without
question
that
endurance
must
mean
undifferentiated
sameness
throughout
the
life-history
concerned?
perhaps
you
noticed
that
in
a
previous
chapter
i
used
the
word
â€˜reiterationâ€™
as
a
synonym
of
â€˜endurance.â€™
it
obviously
is
not
quite
synonymous
in
its
meaning
and
now
i
want
to
suggest
that
reiteration
where
it
differs
from
endurance
is
more
nearly
what
the
organic
theory
requires
the
difference
is
very
analogous
to
that
between
the
galileans
and
the
aristotelians:
aristotle
said
â€˜restâ€™
where
galileo
added
â€˜or
uniform
motion
in
a
straight
line.â€™
thus
in
the
organic
theory
a
pattern
need
not
endure
in
undifferentiated
sameness
through
time
the
pattern
may
be
essentially
one
of
aesthetic
contrasts
requiring
a
lapse
of
time
for
its
unfolding
a
tune
is
an
example
of
such
a
pattern
thus
the
endurance
of
the
pattern
now
means
the
reiteration
of
its
succession
of
contrasts
this
is
obviously
the
most
general
notion
of
endurance
on
the
organic
theory
and
â€˜reiterationâ€™
is
perhaps
the
word
which
expresses
it
with
most
directness
but
when
we
translate
this
notion
into
the
abstractions
of
physics
it
at
once
becomes
the
technical
notion
of
â€˜vibration.â€™
this
vibration
is
not
the
vibratory
locomotion:
it
is
the
vibration
of
organic
deformation
there
are
certain
indications
in
modern
physics
that
for
the
rã´le
of
corpuscular
organisms
at
the
base
of
the
physical
field
we
require
vibratory
entities
such
corpuscles
would
be
the
corpuscles
detected
as
expelled
from
the
nuclei
of
atoms
which
then
dissolve
into
waves
of
light
we
may
conjecture
that
such
a
corpuscular
body
has
no
great
stability
of
endurance
when
in
isolation
accordingly
an
unfavourable
environment
leading
to
rapid
changes
in
its
proper
space-time
system
that
is
to
say
an
environment
jolting
it
into
violent
accelerations
causes
the
corpuscles
to
go
to
pieces
and
dissolve
into
light-waves
of
the
same
period
of
vibration
a
proton
and
perhaps
an
electron
would
be
an
association
of
such
primates
superposed
on
each
other
with
their
frequencies
and
spatial
dimensions
so
arranged
as
to
promote
the
stability
of
the
complex
organism
when
jolted
into
accelerations
of
locomotion
the
conditions
for
stability
would
give
the
associations
of
periods
possible
for
protons
the
expulsion
of
a
primate
would
come
from
a
jolt
which
leads
the
proton
either
to
settle
down
into
an
alternative
association
or
to
generate
a
new
primate
by
the
aid
of
the
energy
received
a
primate
must
be
associated
with
a
definite
frequency
of
vibratory
organic
deformation
so
that
when
it
goes
to
pieces
it
dissolves
into
light
waves
of
the
same
frequency
which
then
carry
off
all
its
average
energy
it
is
quite
easy
as
a
particular
hypothesis
to
imagine
stationary
vibrations
of
the
electromagnetic
field
of
definite
frequency
and
directed
radially
to
and
from
a
centre
which
in
accordance
with
the
accepted
electromagnetic
laws
would
consist
of
a
vibratory
spherical
nucleus
satisfying
one
set
of
conditions
and
a
vibratory
external
field
satisfying
another
set
of
conditions
this
is
an
example
of
vibratory
organic
deformation
further
on
this
particular
hypothesis
there
are
two
ways
of
determining
the
subsidiary
conditions
so
as
to
satisfy
the
ordinary
requirements
of
mathematical
physics
the
total
energy
according
to
one
of
these
ways
would
satisfy
the
quantum
condition
so
that
it
consists
of
an
integral
number
of
units
or
cents
which
are
such
that
the
cent
of
energy
of
any
primate
is
proportional
to
its
frequency
i
have
not
worked
out
the
conditions
for
stability
or
for
a
stable
association
i
have
mentioned
the
particular
hypothesis
by
way
of
showing
by
example
that
the
organic
theory
of
nature
affords
possibilities
for
the
reconsideration
of
ultimate
physical
laws
which
are
not
open
to
the
opposed
materialistic
theory
in
this
particular
hypothesis
of
vibratory
primates
the
maxwellian
equations
are
supposed
to
hold
throughout
all
space
including
the
interior
of
a
proton
they
express
the
laws
governing
the
vibratory
production
and
absorption
of
energy
the
whole
process
for
each
primate
issues
in
a
certain
average
energy
characteristic
of
the
primate
and
proportional
to
its
mass
in
fact
the
energy
is
the
mass
there
are
vibratory
radial
streams
of
energy
both
without
and
within
a
primate
within
the
primate
there
are
vibratory
distributions
of
electric
density
on
the
materialistic
theory
such
density
marks
the
presence
of
material:
on
the
organic
theory
of
vibration
it
marks
the
vibratory
production
of
energy
such
production
is
restricted
to
the
interior
of
the
primate
all
science
must
start
with
some
assumptions
as
to
the
ultimate
analysis
of
the
facts
with
which
it
deals
these
assumptions
are
justified
partly
by
their
adherence
to
the
types
of
occurrence
of
which
we
are
directly
conscious
and
partly
by
their
success
in
representing
the
observed
facts
with
a
certain
generality
devoid
of
ad
hoc
suppositions
the
general
theory
of
the
vibration
of
primates
which
i
have
outlined
is
merely
given
as
an
example
of
the
sort
of
possibilities
which
the
organic
theory
leaves
open
for
physical
science
the
point
is
that
it
adds
the
possibility
of
organic
deformation
to
that
of
mere
locomotion
light
waves
form
one
great
example
of
organic
deformation
at
any
epoch
the
assumptions
of
a
science
are
giving
way
when
they
exhibit
symptoms
of
the
epicyclic
state
from
which
astronomy
was
rescued
in
the
sixteenth
century
physical
science
is
now
exhibiting
such
symptoms
in
order
to
reconsider
its
foundations
it
must
recur
to
a
more
concrete
view
of
the
character
of
real
things
and
must
conceive
its
fundamental
notions
as
abstractions
derived
from
this
direct
intuition
it
is
in
this
way
that
it
surveys
the
general
possibilities
of
revision
which
are
open
to
it
the
discontinuities
introduced
by
the
quantum
theory
require
revision
of
physical
concepts
in
order
to
meet
them
in
particular
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
some
theory
of
discontinuous
existence
is
required
what
is
asked
from
such
a
theory
is
that
an
orbit
of
an
electron
can
be
regarded
as
a
series
of
detached
positions
and
not
as
a
continuous
line
the
theory
of
a
primate
or
a
vibrating
pattern
given
above
together
with
the
distinction
between
temporality
and
extensiveness
in
the
previous
chapter
yields
exactly
this
result
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
continuity
of
the
complex
of
events
arises
from
the
relationships
of
extensiveness
whereas
the
temporality
arises
from
the
realisation
in
a
subject-event
of
a
pattern
which
requires
for
its
display
that
the
whole
of
a
duration
be
spatialised
i.e
arrested
as
given
by
its
aspects
in
the
event
thus
realization
proceeds
viã¢
a
succession
of
epochal
durations
and
the
continuous
transition
i.e
the
organic
deformation
is
within
the
duration
which
is
already
given
the
vibratory
organic
deformation
is
in
fact
the
reiteration
of
the
pattern
one
complete
period
defines
the
duration
required
for
the
complete
pattern
thus
the
primate
is
realised
atomically
in
a
succession
of
durations
each
duration
to
be
measured
from
one
maximum
to
another
accordingly
so
far
as
the
primate
as
one
enduring
whole
entity
is
to
be
taken
account
of
it
is
to
be
assigned
to
these
durations
successively
if
it
is
considered
as
one
thing
its
orbit
is
to
be
diagrammatically
exhibited
by
a
series
of
detached
dots
thus
the
locomotion
of
the
primate
is
discontinuous
in
space
and
time
if
we
go
below
the
quanta
of
time
which
are
the
successive
vibratory
periods
of
the
primate
we
find
a
succession
of
vibratory
electromagnetic
fields
each
stationary
in
the
space-time
of
its
own
duration
each
of
these
fields
exhibits
a
single
complete
period
of
the
electromagnetic
vibration
which
constitutes
the
primate
this
vibration
is
not
to
be
thought
of
as
the
becoming
of
reality
it
is
what
the
primate
is
in
one
of
its
discontinuous
realisations
also
the
successive
durations
in
which
the
primate
is
realised
are
contiguous
it
follows
that
the
life
history
of
the
primate
can
be
exhibited
as
being
the
continuous
development
of
occurrences
in
the
electromagnetic
field
but
these
occurrences
enter
into
realisation
as
whole
atomic
blocks
occupying
definite
periods
of
time
there
is
no
need
to
conceive
that
time
is
atomic
in
the
sense
that
all
patterns
must
be
realised
in
the
same
successive
durations
in
the
first
place
even
if
the
periods
were
the
same
in
the
case
of
two
primates
the
durations
of
realisation
may
not
be
the
same
in
other
words
the
two
primates
may
be
out
of
phase
also
if
the
periods
are
different
the
atomism
of
any
one
duration
of
one
primate
is
necessarily
subdivided
by
the
boundary
moments
of
durations
of
the
other
primate
the
laws
of
the
locomotion
of
primates
express
under
what
conditions
any
primate
will
change
its
space-time
system
it
is
unnecessary
to
pursue
this
conception
further
the
justification
of
the
concept
of
vibratory
existence
must
be
purely
experimental
the
point
illustrated
by
this
example
is
that
the
cosmological
outlook
which
is
here
adopted
is
perfectly
consistent
with
the
demands
for
discontinuity
which
have
been
urged
from
the
side
of
physics
also
if
this
concept
of
temporalisation
as
a
successive
realisation
of
epochal
durations
be
adopted
the
difficulty
of
zeno
is
evaded
the
particular
form
which
has
been
given
here
to
this
concept
is
purely
for
that
purpose
of
illustration
and
must
necessarily
require
recasting
before
it
can
be
adapted
to
the
results

in
the
present
lecture
it
is
my
object
to
consider
some
reactions
of
science
upon
the
stream
of
philosophic
thought
during
the
modern
centuries
with
which
we
are
concerned

shall
make
no
attempt
to
compress
a
history
of
modern
philosophy
within
the
limits
of
one
lecture
we
shall
merely
consider
some
contacts
between
science
and
philosophy
in
so
far
as
they
lie
within
the
scheme
of
thought
which
it
is
the
purpose
of
these
lectures
to
develop
for
this
reason
the
whole
of
the
great
german
idealistic
movement
will
be
ignored
as
being
out
of
effective
touch
with
its
contemporary
science
so
far
as
reciprocal
modification
of
concepts
is
concerned
kant
from
whom
this
movement
took
its
rise
was
saturated
with
newtonian
physics
and
with
the
ideas
of
the
great
french
physicistsâ€”such
as
clairaut,[11
for
instanceâ€”who
developed
the
newtonian
ideas
but
the
philosophers
who
developed
the
kantian
school
of
thought
or
who
transformed
it
into
hegelianism
either
lacked
kantâ€™s
background
of
scientific
knowledge
or
lacked
his
potentiality
of
becoming
a
great
physicist
if
philosophy
had
not
absorbed
his
main
energies

an
unnecessarily
complex
illustration
a
book
resting
on
a
table
would
have
equally
well
sufficed
but
the
subject
had
just
been
adequately
treated
for
the
first
time
by
clairaut
in
an
appendix
to
his
figure
of
the
earth
kant
evidently
had
read
this
appendix
and
his
mind
was
full
of
it
the
origin
of
modern
philosophy
is
analogous
to
that
of
science
and
is
contemporaneous
the
general
trend
of
its
development
was
settled
in
the
seventeenth
century
partly
at
the
hands
of
the
same
men
who
established
the
scientific
principles
this
settlement
of
purpose
followed
upon
a
transitional
period
dating
from
the
fifteenth
century
there
was
in
fact
a
general
movement
of
european
mentality
which
carried
along
with
its
stream
religion
science
and
philosophy
it
may
shortly
be
characterised
as
being
the
direct
recurrence
to
the
original
sources
of
greek
inspiration
on
the
part
of
men
whose
spiritual
shape
had
been
derived
from
inheritance
from
the
middle
ages
there
was
therefore
no
revival
of
greek
mentality
epochs
do
not
rise
from
the
dead
the
principles
of
aesthetics
and
of
reason
which
animated
the
greek
civilisation
were
reclothed
in
a
modern
mentality
between
the
two
there
lay
other
religions
other
systems
of
law
other
anarchies
and
other
racial
inheritances
dividing
the
living
from
the
dead
philosophy
is
peculiarly
sensitive
to
such
differences
for
whereas
you
can
make
a
replica
of
an
ancient
statue
there
is
no
possible
replica
of
an
ancient
state
of
mind
there
can
be
no
nearer
approximation
than
that
which
a
masquerade
bears
to
real
life
there
may
be
understanding
of
the
past
but
there
is
a
difference
between
the
modern
and
the
ancient
reactions
to
the
same
stimuli
in
the
particular
case
of
philosophy
the
distinction
in
tonality
lies
on
the
surface
modern
philosophy
is
tinged
with
subjectivism
as
against
the
objective
attitude
of
the
ancients
the
same
change
is
to
be
seen
in
religion
in
the
early
history
of
the
christian
church
the
theological
interest
centred
in
discussions
on
the
nature
of
god
the
meaning
of
the
incarnation
and
apocalyptic
forecasts
of
the
ultimate
fate
of
the
world
at
the
reformation
the
church
was
torn
asunder
by
dissension
as
to
the
individual
experiences
of
believers
in
respect
to
justification
the
individual
subject
of
experience
had
been
substituted
for
the
total
drama
of
all
reality
luther
asked
â€˜how
am
i
justified?â€™
modern
philosophers
have
asked
â€˜how
do
i
have
knowledge?â€™
the
emphasis
lies
upon
the
subject
of
experience
this
change
of
standpoint
is
the
work
of
christianity
in
its
pastoral
aspect
of
shepherding
the
company
of
believers
for
century
after
century
it
insisted
upon
the
infinite
worth
of
the
individual
human
soul
accordingly
to
the
instinctive
egotism
of
physical
desires
it
has
superadded
an
instinctive
feeling
of
justification
for
an
egotism

intellectual
outlook
every
human
being
is
the
natural
guardian
of
his
own
importance

a
doubt
this
modern
direction

attention

the
highest
value

imagination

mankind
descartes
in
his
discourse
on
method
and
in
his
meditations
discloses
with
great
clearness
the
general
conceptions
which
have
since
influenced
modern
philosophy
there
is
a
subject
receiving
experience:
in
the
discourse
this
subject
is
always
mentioned
in
the
first
person
that
is
to
say
as
being
descartes
himself
descartes
starts
with
himself
as
being
a
mentality
which
in
virtue
of
its
consciousness
of
its
own
inherent
presentations
of
sense
and
of
thought
is
thereby
conscious
of
its
own
existence
as
a
unit
entity
the
subsequent
history
of
philosophy
revolves
round
the
cartesian
formulation
of
the
primary
datum
the
ancient
world
takes
its
stand
upon
the
drama
of
the
universe
the
modern
world
upon
the
inward
drama
of
the
soul
descartes
in
his
meditations
expressly
grounds
the
existence
of
this
inward
drama
upon
the
possibility
of
error
there
may
be
no
correspondence
with
objective
fact
and
thus
there
must
be
a
soul
with
activities
whose
reality
is
purely
derivative
from
itself
for
example
here
is
a
quotation[12
from
meditation
ii_:
â€œbut
it
will
be
said
that
these
presentations
are
false
and
that
i
am
dreaming
let
it
be
so
at
all
events
it
is
certain
that
i
seem
to
see
light
hear
a
noise
and
feel
heat
this
cannot
be
false
and
this
is
what
in
me
is
properly
called
perceiving
sentire
which
is
nothing
else
than
thinking
from
this
i
begin
to
know
what
i
am
with
somewhat
greater
clearness
and
distinctness
than
heretofore.â€
again
in
meditation
iii_:
â€œ
for
as
i
before
remarked
although
the
things
which
i
perceive
or
imagine
are
perhaps
nothing
at
all
apart
from
me
i
am
nevertheless
assured
that
those
modes
of
consciousness
which
i
call
perceptions
and
imaginations
in
as
far
only
as
they
are
modes
of
consciousness
exist
in
me.â€

apart
from

nature
in
scientific
thought
has
had
its
laws
formulated
without
any
reference
to
dependence
on
individual
observers
there
is
however
this
difference
between
the
older
and
the
later
attitudes
towards
science
the
anti-rationalism
of
the
moderns
has
checked
any
attempt
to
harmonise
the
ultimate
concepts
of

ideas
drawn
from
a
more
concrete
survey

the

time

various
laws
concerning
the

taken
as
ultimate
stubborn
facts
not
to
be
tampered
with
the
effect
of
this
antagonism
to
philosophy
has
been
equally
unfortunate
both
for
philosophy
and
for
science
in
this
lecture
we
are
concerned
with
philosophy
philosophers
are
rationalists
they
are
seeking
to
go
behind
stubborn
and
irreducible
facts:
they
wish
to
explain
in
the
light
of
universal
principles
the
mutual
reference
between
the
various
details
entering
into
the
flux
of
things
also
they
seek
such
principles
as
will
eliminate
mere
arbitrariness
so
that
whatever
portion
of
fact
is
assumed
or
given
the
existence
of
the
remainder
of
things
shall
satisfy
some
demand
of
rationality
they
demand
meaning
in
the
words
of
henry
sidgwick[13]â€”â€œit
is
the
primary
aim
of
philosophy
to
unify
completely
bring
into
clear
coherence
all
departments
of
rational
thought
and
this
aim
cannot
be
realised
by
any
philosophy
that
leaves
out
of
its
view
the
important
body
of
judgments
and
reasonings
which
form
the
subject
matter
of
ethics.â€
accordingly
the
bias
towards
history
on
the
part
of
the
physical
and
social
sciences
with
their
refusal
to
rationalise
below
some
ultimate
mechanism
has
pushed
philosophy
out
of
the
effective
currents
of
modern
life
it
has
lost
its
proper
rã´le
as
a
constant
critic
of
partial
formulations
it
has
retreated
into
the
subjectivist
sphere
of
mind
by
reason
of
its
expulsion
by
science
from
the
objectivist
sphere
of
matter
thus
the
evolution
of
thought
in
the
seventeenth
century
coã¶perated
with
the
enhanced
sense
of
individual
personality
derived
from
the
middle
ages
we
see
descartes
taking
his
stand
upon
his
own
ultimate
mind
which
his
philosophy
assures
him
of
and
asking
about
its
relations
to
the
ultimate
matterâ€”exemplified
in
the
second
meditation
by
the
human
body
and
a
lump
of
waxâ€”which
his
science
assumes
there
is
aaronâ€™s
rod
and
the
magiciansâ€™
serpents
and
the
only
question
for
philosophy
is
which
swallows
which

whether

a
general
change
in
a
climate
of
thought
to
any
one
piece
of
writing
or
to
any
one
author
no
doubt
descartes
only
expressed
definitely
and
in
decisive
form
what
was
already
in
the
air
of
his
period
analogously
in
attributing
to
william
james
the
inauguration
of
a
new
stage
in
philosophy
we
should
be
neglecting
other
influences
of
his
time
but
admitting
this
there
still
remains
a
certain
fitness
in
contrasting
his
essay
does
consciousness
exist
published
in
1904
with
descartesâ€™
discourse
on
method
published
in
1637
james
clears
the
stage
of
the
old
paraphernalia
or
rather
he
entirely
alters
its
lighting
take
for
example
these
two
sentences
from
his
essay:
â€œto
deny
plumply
that
â€˜consciousnessâ€™
exists
seems
so
absurd
on
the
face
of
itâ€”for
undeniably
â€˜thoughtsâ€™
do
existâ€”that
i
fear
some
readers
will
follow
me
no
farther
let
me
then
immediately
explain
that
i
mean
only
to
deny
that
the
word
stands
for
an
entity
but
to
insist
most
emphatically
that
it
does
stand
for
a
function.â€
the
scientific
materialism
and
the
cartesian
ego
were
both
challenged
at
the
same
moment
one
by
science
and
the
other
by
philosophy
as
represented
by
william
james
with
his
psychological
antecedents
and
the
double
challenge
marks
the
end
of
a
period
which
lasted
for
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
of
course
â€˜matterâ€™
and
â€˜consciousnessâ€™
both
express
something
so
evident
in
ordinary
experience
that
any
philosophy
must
provide
some
things
which
answer
to
their
respective
meanings
but
the
point
is
that
in
respect
to
both
of
them
the
seventeenth
century
settlement
was
infected
with
a
presupposition
which
is
now
challenged
james
denies
that
consciousness
is
an
entity
but
admits
that
it
is
a
function
the
discrimination
between
an
entity
and
a
function
is
therefore
vital
to
the
understanding
of
the
challenge
which
james
is
advancing
against
the
older
modes
of
thought
in
the
essay
in
question
the
character
which
james
assigns
to
consciousness
is
fully
discussed
but
he
does
not
unambiguously
explain
what
he
means
by
the
notion
of
an
entity
which
he
refuses
to
apply
to
consciousness
in
the
sentence
which
immediately
follows
the
one
which
i
have
already
quoted
he
says:
â€œthere
is
i
mean
no
aboriginal
stuff
or
quality
of
being
contrasted
with
that
of
which
material
objects
are
made
out
of
which
our
thoughts
of
them
are
made
but
there
is
a
function
in
experience
which
thoughts
perform
and
for
the
performance
of
which
this
quality
of
being
is
invoked
that
function
is
knowing
â€˜consciousnessâ€™
is
supposed
necessary
to
explain
the
fact
that
things
not
only
are
but
get
reported
are
known.â€
thus
james
is
denying
that
consciousness
is
a
â€˜stuff.â€™
the
term
â€˜entity,â€™
or
even
that
of
â€˜stuff,â€™
does
not
fully
tell
its
own
tale
the
notion
of
â€˜entityâ€™
is
so
general
that
it
may
be
taken
to
mean
anything
that
can
be
thought
about
you
cannot
think
of
mere
nothing
and
the
something
which
is
an
object
of
thought
may
be
called
an
entity
in
this
sense
a
function
is
an
entity
obviously
this
is
not
what
james
had
in
his
mind
in
agreement
with
the
organic
theory
of
nature
which
i
have
been
tentatively
putting
forward
in
these
lectures
i
shall
for
my
own
purposes
construe
james
as
denying
exactly
what
descartes
asserts
in
his
discourse
and
his
meditations
descartes
discriminates
two
species
of
entities
matter
and
soul
the
essence
of
matter
is
spatial
extension
the
essence
of
soul
is
its
cogitation
in
the
full
sense
which
descartes
assigns
to
the
word
â€˜_cogitare_.â€™
for
example
in
section
fifty-three
of
part
i
of
his
principles
of
philosophy
he
enunciates:
â€œthat
of
every
substance
there
is
one
principal
attribute
as
thinking
of
the
mind
extension
of
the
body.â€
in
the
earlier
fifty-first
section
descartes
states:
â€œby
substance
we
can
conceive
nothing
else
than
a
thing
which
exists
in
such
a
way
as
to
stand
in
need
of
nothing
beyond
itself
in
order
to
its
existence.â€
furthermore
later
on
descartes
says:
â€œfor
example
because
any
substance
which
ceases
to
endure
ceases
also
to
exist
duration
is
not
distinct
from
substance
except
in
thought;....â€
thus
we
conclude
that
for
descartes
minds
and
bodies
exist
in
such
a
way
as
to
stand
in
need
of
nothing
beyond
themselves
individually
god
only
excepted
as
being
the
foundation
of
all
things
that
both
minds
and
bodies
endure
because
without
endurance
they
would
cease
to
exist
that
spatial
extension
is
the
essential
attribute
of
bodies
and
that
cogitation
is
the
essential
attribute
of
minds
it
is
difficult
to
praise
too
highly
the
genius
exhibited
by
descartes
in
the
complete
sections
of
his
principles
which
deal
with
these
questions
it
is
worthy
of
the
century
in
which
he
writes
and
of
the
clearness
of
the
french
intellect
descartes
in
his
distinction
between
time
and
duration
and
in
his
way
of
grounding
time
upon
motion
and
in
his
close
relation
between
matter
and
extension
anticipates
as
far
as
it
was
possible
at
his
epoch
modern
notions
suggested
by
the
doctrine
of
relativity
or
by
some
aspects
of
bergsonâ€™s
doctrine
of
the
generation
of
things
but
the
fundamental
principles
are
so
set
out
as
to
presuppose
independently
existing
substances
with
simple
location
in
a
community
of
temporal
durations
and
in
the
case
of
bodies
with
simple
location
in
the
community
of
spatial
extensions
those
principles
lead
straight
to
the
theory
of
a
materialistic
mechanistic
nature
surveyed
by
cogitating
minds
after
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
science
took
charge
of
the
materialistic
nature
and
philosophy
took
charge
of
the
cogitating
minds
some
schools
of
philosophy
admitted
an
ultimate
dualism
and
the
various
idealistic
schools
claimed
that
nature
was
merely
the
chief
example
of
the
cogitations
of
minds
but
all
schools
admitted
the
cartesian
analysis
of
the
ultimate
elements
of
nature
i
am
excluding
spinoza
and
leibniz
from
these
statements
as
to
the
main
stream
of
modern
philosophy
as
derivative
from
descartes
though
of
course
they
were
influenced
by
him
and
in
their
turn
influenced
philosophers
i
am
thinking
mainly
of
the
effective
contacts
between
science
and
philosophy
this
division
of
territory
between
science
and
philosophy
was
not
a
simple
business
and
in
fact
it
illustrated
the
weakness
of
the
whole
cut-and-dried
presupposition
upon
which
it
rested
we
are
aware
of
nature
as
an
interplay
of
bodies
colours
sounds
scents
tastes
touches
and
other
various
bodily
feelings
displayed
as
in
space
in
patterns
of
mutual
separation
by
intervening
volumes
and
of
individual
shape
also
the
whole
is
a
flux
changing
with
the
lapse
of
time
this
systematic
totality
is
disclosed
to
us
as
one
complex
of
things
but
the
seventeenth
century
dualism
cuts
straight
across
it
the
objective
world
of
science
was
confined
to
mere
spatial
material
with
simple
location
in
space
and
time
and
subjected
to
definite
rules
as
to
its
locomotion
the
subjective
world
of
philosophy
annexed
the
colours
sounds
scents
tastes
touches
bodily
feelings
as
forming
the
subjective
content
of
the
cogitations
of
the
individual
minds
both
worlds
shared
in
the
general
flux
but
time
as
measured
is
assigned
by
descartes
to
the
cogitations
of
the
observerâ€™s
mind
there
is
obviously
one
fatal
weakness
to
this
scheme
the
cogitations
of
mind
exhibit
themselves
as
holding
up
entities
such
as
colours
for
instance
before
the
mind
as
the
termini
of
contemplation
but
in
this
theory
these
colours
are
after
all
merely
the
furniture
of
the
mind
accordingly
the
mind
seems
to
be
confined
to
its
own
private
world
of
cogitations
the
subject-object
conformation
of
experience
in
its
entirety
lies
within
the
mind
as
one
of
its
private
passions
this
conclusion
from
the
cartesian
data
is
the
starting
point
from
which
berkeley
hume
and
kant
developed
their
respective
systems
and
antecedently
to
them
it
was
the
point
upon
which
locke
concentrated
as
being
the
vital
question
thus
the
question
as
to
how
any
knowledge
is
obtained
of
the
truly
objective
world
of
science
becomes
a
problem
of
the
first
magnitude
descartes
states
that
the
objective
body
is
perceived
by
the
intellect
he
says
meditation
ii_):
â€œi
must
therefore
admit
that
i
cannot
even
comprehend
by
imagination
what
the
piece
of
wax
is
and
that
it
is
the
mind
alone
which
perceives
it
i
speak
of
one
piece
in
particular
for
as
to
wax
in
general
this
is
still
more
evident
but
what
is
the
piece
of
wax
that
can
be
perceived
only
by
the
mind?
the
perception
of
it
is
neither
an
act
of
sight
of
touch
nor
of
imagination
and
never
was
either
of
these
though
it
might
formerly
seem
so
but
is
simply
an
intuition
inspectio
of
the
mind,....â€
it
must
be
noted
that
the
latin
word
â€˜inspectioâ€™
is
associated
in
its
classical
use
with
the
notion
of
theory
as
opposed
to
practice
the
two
great
preoccupations
of
modern
philosophy
now
lie
clearly
before
us
the
study
of
mind
divides
into
psychology
or
the
study
of
mental
functionings
as
considered
in
themselves
and
in
their
mutual
relations
and
into
epistemology
or
the
theory
of
the
knowledge
of
a
common
objective
world
in
other
words
there
is
the
study
of
the
cogitations
quã¢
passions
of
the
mind
and
their
study
quã¢
leading
to
an
inspection
intuition
of
an
objective
world
this
is
a
very
uneasy
division
giving
rise
to
a
host
of
perplexities
whose
consideration
has
occupied
the
intervening
centuries
as
long
as
men
thought
in
terms
of
physical
notions
for
the
objective
world
and
of
mentality
for
the
subjective
world
the
setting
out
of
the
problem
as
achieved
by
descartes
sufficed
as
a
starting
point
but
the
balance
has
been
upset
by
the
rise
of
physiology
in
the
seventeenth
century
men
passed
from
the
study
of
physics
to
the
study
of
philosophy
towards
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
notably
in
germany
men
passed
from
the
study
of
physiology
to
the
study
of
psychology
the
change
in
tone
has
been
decisive
of
course
in
the
earlier
period
the
intervention
of
the
human
body
was
fully
considered
for
example
by
descartes
in
part
v
of
the
â€˜_discourse
on
method_.â€™
but
the
physiological
instinct
had
not
been
developed
in
considering
the
human
body
descartes
thought
with
the
outfit
of
a
physicist
whereas
the
modern
psychologists
are
clothed
with
the
mentalities
of
medical
physiologists
the
career
of
william
james
is
an
example
of
this
change
in
standpoint
he
also
possessed
the
clear
incisive
genius
which
could
state
in
a
flash
the
exact
point
at
issue
the
reason
why
i
have
put
descartes
and
james
in
close
juxtaposition
is
now
evident
neither
philosopher
finished
an
epoch
by
a
final
solution
of
a
problem
their
great
merit
is
of
the
opposite
sort
they
each
of
them
open
an
epoch
by
their
clear
formulation
of
terms
in
which
thought
could
profitably
express
itself
at
particular
stages
of
knowledge
one
for
the
seventeenth
century
the
other
for
the
twentieth
century
in
this
respect
they
are
both
to
be
contrasted
with
st
thomas
aquinas
who
expressed
the
culmination
of
aristotelian
scholasticism
in
many
ways
neither
descartes
nor
james
were
the
most
characteristic
philosophers
of
their
respective
epochs
i
should
be
disposed
to
ascribe
these
positions
to
locke
and
to
bergson
respectively
at
least
so
far
as
concerns
their
relations
to
the
science
of
their
times
locke
developed
the
lines
of
thought
which
kept
philosophy
on
the
move
for
example
he
emphasized
the
appeal
to
psychology
he
initiated
the
age
of
epoch-making
enquiries
into
urgent
problems
of
limited
scope
undoubtedly
in
so
doing
he
infected
philosophy
with
something
of
the
anti-rationalism
of
science
but
the
very
groundwork
of
a
fruitful
methodology
is
to
start
from
those
clear
postulates
which
must
be
held
to
be
ultimate
so
far
as
concerns
the
occasion
in
question
the
criticism
of
such
methodological
postulates
is
thus
reserved
for
another
opportunity
locke
discovered
that
the
philosophical
situation
bequeathed
by
descartes
involved
the
problems
of
epistemology
and
psychology
bergson
introduced
into
philosophy
the
organic
conceptions
of
physiological
science
he
has
most
completely
moved
away
from
the
static
materialism
of
the
seventeenth
century
his
protest
against
spatialisation
is
a
protest
against
taking
the
newtonian
conception
of
nature
as
being
anything
except
a
high
abstraction
his
so-called
anti-intellectualism
should
be
construed
in
this
sense
in
some
respects
he
recurs
to
descartes
but
the
recurrence
is
accompanied
with
an
instinctive
grasp
of
modern
biology
there
is
another
reason
for
associating
locke
and
bergson
the
germ
of
an
organic
theory
of
nature
is
to
be
found
in
locke
his
most
recent
expositor
professor
gibson,[14
states
that
lockeâ€™s
way
of
conceiving
the
identity
of
self-consciousness
â€˜like
that
of
a
living
organism
involves
a
genuine
transcending
of
the
mechanical
view
of
nature
and
of
mind
embodied
in
the
composition
theory.â€™
but
it
is
to
be
noticed
that
in
the
first
place
locke
wavers
in
his
grasp
of
this
position
and
in
the
second
place
what
is
more
important
still
he
only
applies
his
idea
to
self-consciousness
the
physiological
attitude
has
not
yet
established
itself
the
effect
of
physiology
was
to
put
mind
back
into
nature
the
neurologist
traces
first
the
effect
of
stimuli
along
the
bodily
nerves
then
integration
at
nerve
centres
and
finally
the
rise
of
a
projective
reference
beyond
the
body
with
a
resulting
motor
efficacy
in
renewed
nervous
excitement
in
biochemistry
the
delicate
adjustment
of
the
chemical
composition
of
the
parts
to
the
preservation
of
the
whole
organism
is
detected
thus
the
mental
cognition
is
seen
as
the
reflective
experience
of
a
totality
reporting
for
itself
what
it
is
in
itself
as
one
unit
occurrence
this
unit
is
the
integration
of
the
sum
of
its
partial
happenings
but
it
is
not
their
numerical
aggregate
it
has
its
own
unity
as
an
event
this
total
unity
considered
as
an
entity
for
its
own
sake
is
the
prehension
into
unity
of
the
patterned
aspects
of
the
universe
of
events
its
knowledge
of
itself
arises
from
its
own
relevance
to
the
things
of
which
it
prehends
the
aspects
it
knows
the
world
as
a
system
of
mutual
relevance
and
thus
sees
itself
as
mirrored
in
other
things
these
other
things
include
more
especially
the
various
parts
of
its
own
body

it
is
important
to
discriminate
the
bodily
pattern
which
endures
from
the
bodily
event
which
is
pervaded
by
the
enduring
pattern
and
from
the
parts
of
the
bodily
event
the
parts
of
the
bodily
event
are
themselves
pervaded
by
their
own
enduring
patterns
which
form
elements
in
the
bodily
pattern
the
parts
of
the
body
are
really
portions
of
the
environment
of
the
total
bodily
event
but
so
related
that
their
mutual
aspects
each
in
the
other
are
peculiarly
effective
in
modifying
the
pattern
of
either
this
arises
from
the
intimate
character
of
the
relation
of
whole
to
part
thus
the
body
is
a
portion
of
the
environment
for
the
part
and
the
part
is
a
portion
of
the
environment
for
the
body
only
they
are
peculiarly
sensitive
each
to
modifications
of
the
other
this
sensitiveness
is
so
arranged
that
the
part
adjusts
itself
to
preserve
the
stability
of
the
pattern
of
the
body
it
is
a
particular
example
of
the
favourable
environment
shielding
the
organism
the
relation
of
part
to
whole
has
the
special
reciprocity
associated
with
the
notion
of
organism
in
which
the
part
is
for
the
whole
but
this
relation
reigns
throughout
nature
and
does
not
start
with
the
special
case
of
the
higher
organisms
further
viewing
the
question
as
a
matter
of
chemistry
there
is
no
need
to
construe
the
actions
of
each
molecule
in
a
living
body
by
its
exclusive
particular
reference
to
the
pattern
of
the
complete
living
organism
it
is
true
that
each
molecule
is
affected
by
the
aspect
of
this
pattern
as
mirrored
in
it
so
as
to
be
otherwise
than
what
it
would
have
been
if
placed
elsewhere
in
the
same
way
under
some
circumstances
an
electron
may
be
a
sphere
and
under
other
circumstances
an
egg-shaped
volume
the
mode
of
approach
to
the
problem
so
far
as
science
is
concerned
is
merely
to
ask
if
molecules
exhibit
in
living
bodies
properties
which
are
not
to
be
observed
amid
inorganic
surroundings
in
the
same
way
in
a
magnetic
field
soft
iron
exhibits
magnetic
properties
which
are
in
abeyance
elsewhere
the
prompt
self-preservative
actions
of
living
bodies
and
our
experience
of
the
physical
actions
of
our
bodies
following
the
determinations
of
will
suggest
the
modification
of
molecules
in
the
body
as
the
result
of
the
total
pattern
it
seems
possible
that
there
may
be
physical
laws
expressing
the
modification
of
the
ultimate
basic
organisms
when
they
form
part
of
higher
organisms
with
adequate
compactness
of
pattern
it
would
however
be
entirely
in
consonance
with
the
empirically
observed
action
of
environments
if
the
direct
effects
of
aspects
as
between
the
whole
body
and
its
parts
were
negligible
we
should
expect
transmission
in
this
way
the
modification
of
total
pattern
would
transmit
itself
by
means
of
a
series
of
modifications
of
a
descending
series
of
parts
so
that
finally
the
modification
of
the
cell
changes
its
aspect
in
the
molecule
thus
effecting
a
corresponding
alteration
in
the
molecule,â€”or
in
some
subtler
entity
thus
the
question
for
physiology
is
the
question
of
the
physics
of
molecules
in
cells
of
different
characters
we
can
now
see
the
relation
of
psychology
to
physiology
and
to
physics
the
private
psychological
field
is
merely
the
event
considered
from
its
own
standpoint
the
unity
of
this
field
is
the
unity
of
the
event
but
it
is
the
event
as
one
entity
and
not
the
event
as
a
sum
of
parts
the
relations
of
the
parts
to
each
other
and
to
the
whole
are
their
aspects
each
in
the
other
a
body
for
an
external
observer
is
the
aggregate
of
the
aspects
for
him
of
the
body
as
a
whole
and
also
of
the
body
as
a
sum
of
parts
for
the
external
observer
the
aspects
of
shape
and
of
sense-objects
are
dominant
at
least
for
cognition
but
we
must
also
allow
for
the
possibility
that
we
can
detect
in
ourselves
direct
aspects
of
the
mentalities
of
higher
organisms
the
claim
that
the
cognition
of
alien
mentalities
must
necessarily
be
by
means
of
indirect
inferences
from
aspects
of
shape
and
of
sense-objects
is
wholly
unwarranted
by
this
philosophy
of
organism
the
fundamental
principle
is
that
whatever
merges
into
actuality
implants
its
aspects
in
every
individual
event
further
even
for
self-cognition
the
aspects
of
the
parts
of
our
own
bodies
partly
take
the
form
of
aspects
of
shape
and
of
sense-objects
but
that
part
of
the
bodily
event
in
respect
to
which
the
cognitive
mentality
is
associated
is
for
itself
the
unit
psychological
field
its
ingredients
are
not
referent
to
the
event
itself
they
are
aspects
of
what
lies
beyond
that
event
thus
the
self-knowledge
inherent
in
the
bodily
event
is
the
knowledge
of
itself
as
a
complex
unity
whose
ingredients
involve
all
reality
beyond
itself
restricted
under
the
limitation
of
its
pattern
of
aspects
thus
we
know
ourselves
as
a
function
of
unification
of
a
plurality
of
things
which
are
other
than
ourselves
cognition
discloses
an
event
as
being
an
activity
organising
a
real
togetherness
of
alien
things
but
this
psychological
field
does
not
depend
on
its
cognition
so
that
this
field
is
still
a
unit
event
as
abstracted
from
its
self-cognition
accordingly
consciousness
will
be
the
function
of
knowing
but
what
is
known
is
already
a
prehension
of
aspects
of
the
one
real
universe
these
aspects
are
aspects
of
other
events
as
mutually
modifying
each
the
others
in
the
pattern
of
aspects
they
stand
in
their
pattern
of
mutual
relatedness
the
aboriginal
data
in
terms
of
which
the
pattern
weaves
itself
are
the
aspects
of
shapes
of
sense-objects
and
of
other
eternal
objects
whose
self-identity
is
not
dependent
on
the
flux
of
things
wherever
such
objects
have
ingression
into
the
general
flux
they
interpret
events
each
to
the
other
they
are
here
in
the
perceiver
but
as
perceived
by
him
they
convey
for
him
something
of
the
total
flux
which
is
beyond
himself
the
subject-object
relation
takes
its
origin
in
the
double
rã´le
of
these
eternal
objects
they
are
modifications
of
the
subject
but
only
in
their
character
of
conveying
aspects
of
other
subjects
in
the
community
of
the
universe
thus
no
individual
subject
can
have
independent
reality
since
it
is
a
prehension
of
limited
aspects
of
subjects
other
than
itself
the
technical
phrase
â€˜subject-objectâ€™
is
a
bad
term
for
the
fundamental
situation
disclosed
in
experience
it
is
really
reminiscent
of
the
aristotelian
â€˜subject-predicate.â€™
it
already
presupposes
the
metaphysical
doctrine
of
diverse
subjects
qualified
by
their
private
predicates
this
is
the
doctrine
of
subjects
with
private
worlds
of
experience
if
this
be
granted
there
is
no
escape
from
solipsism
the
point
is
that
the
phrase
â€˜subject-objectâ€™
indicates
a
fundamental
entity
underlying
the
objects
thus
the
â€˜objects,â€™
as
thus
conceived
are
merely
the
ghosts
of
aristotelian
predicates
the
primary
situation
disclosed
in
cognitive
experience
is
â€˜ego-object
amid
objects.â€™
by
this
i
mean
that
the
primary
fact
is
an
impartial
world
transcending
the
â€˜here-nowâ€™
which
marks
the
ego-object
and
transcending
the
â€˜nowâ€™
which
is
the
spatial
world
of
simultaneous
realisation
it
is
a
world
also
including
the
actuality
of
the
past
and
the
limited
potentiality
of
the
future
together
with
the
complete
world
of
abstract
potentiality
the
realm
of
eternal
objects
which
transcends
and
finds
exemplification
in
and
comparison
with
the
actual
course
of
realisation
the
ego-object
as
consciousness
here-now
is
conscious
of
its
experient
essence
as
constituted
by
its
internal
relatedness
to
the
world
of
realities
and
to
the
world
of
ideas
but
the
ego-object
in
being
thus
constituted
is
within
the
world
of
realities
and
exhibits
itself
as
an
organism
requiring
the
ingression
of
ideas
for
the
purpose
of
this
status
among
realities
this
question
of
consciousness
must
be
reserved
for
treatment
on
another
occasion
the
point
to
be
made
for
the
purposes
of
the
present
discussion
is
that
a
philosophy
of
nature
as
organic
must
start
at
the
opposite
end
to
that
requisite
for
a
materialistic
philosophy
the
materialistic
starting
point
is
from
independently
existing
substances
matter
and
mind
the
matter
suffers
modifications
of
its
external
relations
of
locomotion
and
the
mind
suffers
modifications
of
its
contemplated
objects
there
are
in
this
materialistic
theory
two
sorts
of
independent
substances
each
qualified
by
their
appropriate
passions
the
organic
starting
point
is
from
the
analysis
of
process
as
the
realisation
of
events
disposed
in
an
interlocked
community
the
event
is
the
unit
of
things
real
the
emergent
enduring
pattern
is
the
stabilisation
of
the
emergent
achievement
so
as
to
become
a
fact
which
retains
its
identity
throughout
the
process
it
will
be
noted
that
endurance
is
not
primarily
the
property
of
enduring
beyond
itself
but
of
enduring
within
itself
i
mean
that
endurance
is
the
property
of
finding
its
pattern
reproduced
in
the
temporal
parts
of
the
total
event
it
is
in
this
sense
that
a
total
event
carries
an
enduring
pattern
there
is
an
intrinsic
value
identical
for
the
whole
and
for
its
succession
of
parts
cognition
is
the
emergence
into
some
measure
of
individualised
reality
of
the
general
substratum
of
activity
poising
before
itself
possibility
actuality
and
purpose
it
is
equally
possible
to
arrive
at
this
organic
conception
of
the
world
if
we
start
from
the
fundamental
notions
of
modern
physics
instead
of
as
above
from
psychology
and
physiology
in
fact
by
reason
of
my
own
studies
in
mathematics
and
mathematical
physics
i
did
in
fact
arrive
at
my
convictions
in
this
way
mathematical
physics
presumes
in
the
first
place
an
electromagnetic
field
of
activity
pervading
space
and
time
the
laws
which
condition
this
field
are
nothing
else
than
the
conditions
observed
by
the
general
activity
of
the
flux
of
the
world
as
it
individualises
itself
in
the
events
in
physics
there
is
an
abstraction
the
science
ignores
what
anything
is
in
itself
its
entities
are
merely
considered
in
respect
to
their
extrinsic
reality
that
is
to
say
in
respect
to
their
aspects
in
other
things
but
the
abstraction
reaches
even
further
than
that
for
it
is
only
the
aspects
in
other
things
as
modifying
the
spatio-temporal
specifications
of
the
life
histories
of
those
other
things
which
count
the
intrinsic
reality
of
the
observer
comes
in:
i
mean
what
the
observer
is
for
himself
is
appealed
to
for
example
the
fact
that
he
will
see
red
or
blue
enters
into
scientific
statements
but
the
red
which
the
observer
sees
does
not
in
truth
enter
into
science
what
is
relevant
is
merely
the
bare
diversity
of
the
observerâ€™s
red
experiences
from
all
of
his
other
experiences
accordingly
the
intrinsic
character
of
the
observer
is
merely
relevant
in
order
to
fix
the
self-identical
individuality
of
the
physical
entities
these
entities
are
only
considered
as
agencies
in
fixing
the
routes
in
space
and
in
time
of
the
life
histories
of
enduring
entities
the
phraseology
of
physics
is
derived
from
the
materialistic
ideas
of
the
seventeenth
century
but
we
find
that
even
in
its
extreme
abstraction
what
it
is
really
presupposing
is
the
organic
theory
of
aspects
as
explained
above
first
consider
any
event
in
empty
space
where
the
word
â€˜emptyâ€™
means
devoid
of
electrons
or
protons
or
of
any
other
form
of
electric
charge
such
an
event
has
three
rã´les
in
physics
in
the
first
place
it
is
the
actual
scene
of
an
adventure
of
energy
either
as
its
habitat
or
as
the
locus
of
a
particular
stream
of
energy:
anyhow
in
this
rã´le
the
energy
is
there
either
as
located
in
space
during
the
time
considered
or
as
streaming
through
space
in
its
second
rã´le
the
event
is
a
necessary
link
in
the
pattern
of
transmission
by
which
the
character
of
every
event
receives
some
modification
from
the
character
of
every
other
event
in
its
third
rã´le
the
event
is
the
repository
of
a
possibility
as
to
what
would
happen
to
an
electric
charge
either
by
way
of
deformation
or
of
locomotion
if
it
should
have
happened
to
be
there
if
we
modify
our
assumption
by
considering
an
event
which
includes
in
itself
a
portion
of
the
life-history
of
an
electric
charge
then
the
analysis
of
its
three
rã´les
still
remains
except
that
the
possibility
embodied
in
the
third
rã´le
is
now
transformed
into
an
actuality
in
this
replacement
of
possibility
by
actuality
we
obtain
the
distinction
between
empty
and
occupied
events
recurring
to
the
empty
events
we
note
the
deficiency
in
them
of
individuality
of
intrinsic
content
considering
the
first
rã´le
of
an
empty
event
as
being
a
habitat
of
energy
we
note
that
there
is
no
individual
discrimination
of
an
individual
bit
of
energy
either
as
statically
located
or
as
an
element
in
the
stream
there
is
simply
a
quantitative
determination
of
activity
without
individualisation
of
the
activity
in
itself
this
lack
of
individualisation
is
still
more
evident
in
the
second
and
third
rã´les
an
empty
event
is
something
in
itself
but
it
fails
to
realise
a
stable
individuality
of
content
so
far
as
its
content
is
concerned
the
empty
event
is
one
realised
element
in
a
general
scheme
of
organised
activity
some
qualification
is
required
when
the
empty
event
is
the
scene
of
the
transmission
of
a
definite
train
of
recurrent
wave-forms
there
is
now
a
definite
pattern
which
remains
permanent
in
the
event
we
find
here
the
first
faint
trace
of
enduring
individuality
but
it
is
individuality
without
the
faintest
capture
of
originality:
for
it
is
merely
a
permanence
arising
solely
from
the
implication
of
the
event
in
a
larger
scheme
of
patterning
turning
now
to
the
examination
of
an
occupied
event
the
electron
has
a
determinate
individuality
it
can
be
traced
throughout
its
life-history
through
a
variety
of
events
a
collection
of
electrons
together
with
the
analogous
atomic
charges
of
positive
electricity
forms
a
body
such
as
we
ordinarily
perceive
the
simplest
body
of
this
kind
is
a
molecule
and
a
set
of
molecules
forms
a
lump
of
ordinary
matter
such
as
a
chair
or
a
stone
thus
a
charge
of
electricity
is
the
mark
of
individuality
of
content
as
additional
to
the
individuality
of
an
event
in
itself
this
individuality
of
content
is
the
strong
point
of
the
materialistic
doctrine
it
can
however
be
equally
well
explained
on
the
theory
of
organism
when
we
look
into
the
function
of
the
electric
charge
we
note
that
its
rã´le
is
to
mark
the
origination
of
a
pattern
which
is
transmitted
through
space
and
time
it
is
the
key
of
some
particular
pattern
for
example
the
field
of
force
in
any
event
is
to
be
constructed
by
attention
to
the
adventures
of
electrons
and
protons
and
so
also
are
the
streams
and
distributions
of
energy
further
the
electric
waves
find
their
origin
in
the
vibratory
adventures
of
these
charges
thus
the
transmitted
pattern
is
to
be
conceived
as
the
flux
of
aspects
throughout
space
and
time
derived
from
the
life
history
of
the
atomic
charge
the
individualisation
of
the
charge
arises
by
a
conjunction
of
two
characters
in
the
first
place
by
the
continued
identity
of
its
mode
of
functioning
as
a
key
for
the
determination
of
a
diffusion
of
pattern
and
in
the
second
place
by
the
unity
and
continuity
of
its
life
history
we
may
conclude
therefore
that
the
organic
theory
represents
directly
what
physics
actually
does
assume
respecting
its
ultimate
entities
we
also
notice
the
complete
futility
of
these
entities
if
they
are
conceived
as
fully
concrete
individuals
so
far
as
physics
is
concerned
they
are
wholly
occupied
in
moving
each
other
about
and
they
have
no
reality
outside
this
function
in
particular
for
physics
there
is
no
intrinsic
reality
it
is
obvious
that
the
basing
of
philosophy
upon
the
presupposition
of
organism
must
be
traced
back
to
leibniz.[15
his
monads
are
for
him
the
ultimately
real
entities
but
he
retained
the
cartesian
substances
with
their
qualifying
passions
as
also
equally
expressing
for
him
the
final
characterisation
of
real
things
accordingly
for
him
there
was
no
concrete
reality
of
internal
relations
he
had
therefore
on
his
hands
two
distinct
points
of
view
one
was
that
the
final
real
entity
is
an
organising
activity
fusing
ingredients
into
a
unity
so
that
this
unity
is
the
reality
the
other
point
of
view
is
that
the
final
real
entities
are
substances
supporting
qualities
the
first
point
of
view
depends
upon
the
acceptance
of
internal
relations
binding
together
all
reality
the
latter
is
inconsistent
with
the
reality
of
such
relations
to
combine
these
two
points
of
view
his
monads
were
therefore
windowless
and
their
passions
merely
mirrored
the
universe
by
the
divine
arrangement
of
a
preã«stablished
harmony
this
system
thus
presupposed
an
aggregate
of
independent
entities
he
did
not
discriminate
the
event
as
the
unit
of
experience
from
the
enduring
organism
as
its
stabilisation
into
importance
and
from
the
cognitive
organism
as
expressing
an
increased
completeness
of
individualisation
nor
did
he
admit
the
many-termed
relations
relating
sense-data
to
various
events
in
diverse
ways
these
many-termed
relations
are
in
fact
the
perspectives
which
leibniz
does
admit
but
only
on
the
condition
that
they
are
purely
qualities
of
the
organising
monads
the
difficulty
really
arises
from
the
unquestioned
acceptance
of
the
notion
of
simple
location
as
fundamental
for
space
and
time
and
from
the
acceptance
of
the
notion
of
independent
individual
substance
as
fundamental
for
a
real
entity
the
only
road
open
to
leibniz
was
thus
the
same
as
that
later
taken
by
berkeley
in
a
prevalent
interpretation
of
his
meaning
namely
an
appeal
to
a
deux
ex
machinã¢
who
was
capable
of
rising
superior
to
the
difficulties
of
metaphysics

the
philosophy
of
leibniz
for
the
suggestion
of
this
line
of
thought
in
the
same
way
as
descartes
introduced
the
tradition
of
thought
which
kept
subsequent
philosophy
in
some
measure
of
contact
with
the
scientific
movement
so
leibniz
introduced
the
alternative
tradition
that
the
entities
which
are
the
ultimate
actual
things
are
in
some
sense
procedures
of
organisation
this

have
had

slight
effect

it
should
be
the

to
bring
together
the
two
streams
into
an
expression

the
world-picture
derived
from

chapter

abstraction
in
the
previous
chapters
i
have
been
examining
the
reactions
of
the
scientific
movement
upon
the
deeper
issues
which
have
occupied
modern
thinkers
no
one
man
no
limited
society
of
men
and
no
one
epoch
can
think
of
everything
at
once
accordingly
for
the
sake
of
eliciting
the
various
impacts
of
science
upon
thought
the
topic
has
been
treated
historically
in
this
retrospect
i
have
kept
in
mind
that
the
ultimate
issue
of
the
whole
story
is
the
patent
dissolution
of
the
comfortable
scheme
of
scientific
materialism
which
has
dominated
the
three
centuries
under
review
accordingly
various
schools
of
criticism
of
the
dominant
opinions
have
been
stressed
and
i
have
endeavoured
to
outline
an
alternative
cosmological
doctrine
which
shall
be
wide
enough
to
include
what
is
fundamental
both
for
science
and
for
its
critics
in
this
alternative
scheme
the
notion
of
material
as
fundamental
has
been
replaced
by
that
of
organic
synthesis
but
the
approach
has
always
been
from
the
consideration
of
the
actual
intricacies
of
scientific
thought
and
of
the
peculiar
perplexities
which
it
suggests
in
the
present
chapter
and
in
the
immediately
succeeding
chapter
we
will
forget
the
peculiar
problems
of
modern
science
and
will
put
ourselves
at
the
standpoint
of
a
dispassionate
consideration
of
the
nature
of
things
antecedently
to
any
special
investigation
into
their
details
such
a
standpoint
is
termed
â€˜metaphysical.â€™
accordingly
those
readers
who
find
metaphysics
even
in
two
slight
chapters
irksome
will
do
well
to
proceed
at
once
to
the
chapter
on
â€˜religion
and
science,â€™
which
resumes
the
topic
of
the
impact
of
science
on
modern
thought
these
metaphysical
chapters
are
purely
descriptive
their
justification
is
to
be
sought
i
in
our
direct
knowledge
of
the
actual
occasions
which
compose
our
immediate
experience
and
ii
in
their
success
as
forming
a
basis
for
harmonising
our
systematised
accounts
of
various
types
of
experience
and
iii
in
their
success
as
providing
the
concepts
in
terms
of
which
an
epistemology
can
be
framed
by
iii
i
mean
that
an
account
of
the
general
character
of
what
we
know
must
enable
us
to
frame
an
account
of
how
knowledge
is
possible
as
an
adjunct
within
things
known
in
any
occasion
of
cognition
that
which
is
known
is
an
actual
occasion
of
experience
as
diversified[16
by
reference
to
a
realm
of
entities
which
transcend
that
immediate
occasion
in
that
they
have
analogous
or
different
connections
with
other
occasions
of
experience
for
example
a
definite
shade
of
red
may
in
the
immediate
occasion
be
implicated
with
the
shape
of
sphericity
in
some
definite
way
but
that
shade
of
red
and
that
spherical
shape
exhibit
themselves
as
transcending
that
occasion
in
that
either
of
them
has
other
relationships
to
other
occasions
also
apart
from
the
actual
occurrence
of
the
same
things
in
other
occasions
every
actual
occasion
is
set
within
a
realm
of
alternative
interconnected
entities
this
realm
is
disclosed
by
all
the
untrue
propositions
which
can
be
predicated
significantly
of
that
occasion
it
is
the
realm
of
alternative
suggestions
whose
foothold
in
actuality
transcends
each
actual
occasion
the
real
relevance
of
untrue
propositions
for
each
actual
occasion
is
disclosed
by
art
romance
and
by
criticism
in
reference
to
ideals
it
is
the
foundation
of
the
metaphysical
position
which
i
am
maintaining
that
the
understanding
of
actuality
requires
a
reference
to
ideality
the
two
realms
are
intrinsically
inherent
in
the
total
metaphysical
situation
the
truth
that
some
proposition
respecting
an
actual
occasion
is
untrue
may
express
the
vital
truth
as
to
the
aesthetic
achievement
it
expresses
the
â€˜great
refusalâ€™
which
is
its
primary
characteristic
an
event
is
decisive
in
proportion
to
the
importance
for
it
of
its
untrue
propositions:
their
relevance
to
the
event
cannot
be
dissociated
from
what
the
event
is
in
itself
by
way
of
achievement
these
transcendent
entities
have
been
termed
â€˜universals.â€™
i
prefer
to
use
the
term
â€˜eternal
objects,â€™
in
order
to
disengage
myself
from
presuppositions
which
cling
to
the
former
term
owing
to
its
prolonged
philosophical
history
eternal
objects
are
thus
in
their
nature
abstract
by
â€˜abstractâ€™
i
mean
that
what
an
eternal
object
is
in
itselfâ€”that
is
to
say
its
essenceâ€”is
comprehensible
without
reference
to
some
one
particular
occasion
of
experience
to
be
abstract
is
to
transcend
particular
concrete
occasions
of
actual
happening
but
to
transcend
an
actual
occasion
does
not
mean
being
disconnected
from
it
on
the
contrary
i
hold
that
each
eternal
object
has
its
own
proper
connection
with
each
such
occasion
which
i
term
its
mode
of
ingression
into
that
occasion
thus
an
eternal
object
is
to
be
comprehended
by
acquaintance
with
i
its
particular
individuality
ii
its
general
relationships
to
other
eternal
objects
as
apt
for
realisation
in

these
three
headings
express
two
principles
the
first
principle
is
that
each
eternal
object
is
an
individual
which
in
its
own
peculiar
fashion
is
what
it
is
this
particular
individuality
is
the
individual
essence
of
the
object
and
cannot
be
described
otherwise
than
as
being
itself
thus
the
individual
essence
is
merely
the
essence
considered
in
respect
to
its
uniqueness
further
the
essence
of
an
eternal
object
is
merely
the
eternal
object
considered
as
adding
its
own
unique
contribution
to
each
actual
occasion
this
unique
contribution
is
identical
for
all
such
occasions
in
respect
to
the
fact
that
the
object
in
all
modes
of
ingression
is
just
its
identical
self
but
it
varies
from
one
occasion
to
another
in
respect
to
the
differences
of
its
modes
of
ingression
thus
the
metaphysical
status
of
an
eternal
object
is
that
of
a
possibility
for
an
actuality
every
actual
occasion
is
defined
as
to
its
character
by
how
these
possibilities
are
actualised
for
that
occasion
thus
actualisation
is
a
selection
among
possibilities
more
accurately
it
is
a
selection
issuing
in
a
gradation
of
possibilities
in
respect
to
their
realisation
in
that
occasion
this
conclusion
brings
us
to
the
second
metaphysical
principle:
an
eternal
object
considered
as
an
abstract
entity
cannot
be
divorced
from
its
reference
to
other
eternal
objects
and
from
its
reference
to
actuality
generally
though
it
is
disconnected
from
its
actual
modes
of
ingression
into
definitive
actual
occasions
this
principle
is
expressed
by
the
statement
that
each
eternal
object
has
a
â€˜relational
essence.â€™
this
relational
essence
determines
how
it
is
possible
for
the
object
to
have
ingression
into
actual
occasions
in
other
words:
if
a
be
an
eternal
object
then
what
a
is
in
itself
involves
aâ€™s
status
in
the
universe
and
a
cannot
be
divorced
from
this
status
in
the
essence
of
a
there
stands
a
determinateness
as
to
the
relationships
of
a
to
other
eternal
objects
and
an
indeterminateness
as
to
the
relationships
of
a
to
actual
occasions
since
the
relationships
of
a
to
other
eternal
objects
stand
determinately
in
the
essence
of
a
it
follows
that
they
are
internal
relations
i
mean
by
this
that
these
relationships
are
constitutive
of
a
for
an
entity
which
stands
in
internal
relations
has
no
being
as
an
entity
not
in
these
relations
in
other
words
once
with
internal
relations
always
with
internal
relations
the
internal
relationships
of
a
conjointly
form
its
significance
again
an
entity
cannot
stand
in
external
relations
unless
in
its
essence
there
stands
an
indeterminateness
which
is
its
patience
for
such
external
relations
the
meaning
of
the
term
â€˜possibilityâ€™
as
applied
to
a
is
simply
that
there
stands
in
the
essence
of
a
a
patience
for
relationships
to
actual
occasions
the
relationships
of
a
to
an
actual
occasion
are
simply
how
the
eternal
relationships
of
a
to
other
eternal
objects
are
graded
as
to
their
realisation
in
that
occasion
thus
the
general
principle
which
expresses
aâ€™s
ingression
in
the
particular
actual
occasion
î±
is
the
indeterminateness
which
stands
in
the
essence
of
a
as
to
its
ingression
into
î±
and
is
the
determinateness
which
stands
in
the
essence
of
î±
as
to
the
ingression
of
î‘
into
î±
thus
the
synthetic
prehension
which
is
î±
is
the
solution
of
the
indeterminateness
of
î‘
into
the
determinateness
of
î±
accordingly
the
relationship
between
î‘
and
î±
is
external
as
regards
î‘
and
is
internal
as
regards
î±
every
actual
occasion
î±
is
the
solution
of
all
modalities
into
actual
categorical
ingressions:
truth
and
falsehood
take
the
place
of
possibility
the
complete
ingression
of
î‘
into
î±
is
expressed
by
all
the
true
propositions
which
are
about
both
î‘
and
î±
and
alsoâ€”it
may
beâ€”about
other
things
the
determinate
relatedness
of
the
eternal
object
î‘
to
every
other
eternal
object
is
how
î‘
is
systematically
and
by
the
necessity
of
its
nature
related
to
every
other
eternal
object
such
relatedness
represents
a
possibility
for
realisation
but
a
relationship
is
a
fact
which
concerns
all
the
implicated
relata
and
cannot
be
isolated
as
if
involving
only
one
of
the
relata
accordingly
there
is
a
general
fact
of
systematic
mutual
relatedness
which
is
inherent
in
the
character
of
possibility
the
realm
of
eternal
objects
is
properly
described
as
a
â€˜realm,â€™
because
each
eternal
object
has
its
status
in
this
general
systematic
complex
of
mutual
relatedness
in
respect
to
the
ingression
of
î‘
into
an
actual
occasion
î±
the
mutual
relationships
of
î‘
to
other
eternal
objects
as
thus
graded
in
realisation
require
for
their
expression
a
reference
to
the
status
of
î‘
and
of
the
other
eternal
objects
in
the
spatio-temporal
relationship
also
this
status
is
not
expressible
for
this
purpose
without
a
reference
to
the
status
of
î±
and
of
other
actual
occasions
in
the
same
spatio-temporal
relationship
accordingly
the
spatio-temporal
relationship
in
terms
of
which
the
actual
course
of
events
is
to
be
expressed
is
nothing
else
than
a
selective
limitation
within
the
general
systematic
relationships
among
eternal
objects
by
â€˜limitation,â€™
as
applied
to
the
spatio-temporal
continuum
i
mean
those
matter-of-fact
determinationsâ€”such
as
the
three
dimensions
of
space
and
the
four
dimensions
of
the
spatio-temporal
continuumâ€”which
are
inherent
in
the
actual
course
of
events
but
which
present
themselves
as
arbitrary
in
respect
to
a
more
abstract
possibility
the
consideration
of
these
general
limitations
at
the
base
of
actual
things
as
distinct
from
the
limitations
peculiar
to
each
actual
occasion
will
be
more
fully
resumed
in
the
chapter
on
â€˜god.â€™
further
the
status
of
all
possibility
in
reference
to
actuality
requires
a
reference
to
this
spatio-temporal
continuum
in
any
particular
consideration
of
a
possibility
we
may
conceive
this
continuum
to
be
transcended
but
in
so
far
as
there
is
any
definite
reference
to
actuality
the
definite
how
of
transcendence
of
that
spatio-temporal
continuum
is
required
thus
primarily
the
spatio-temporal
continuum
is
a
locus
of
relational
possibility
selected
from
the
more
general
realm
of
systematic
relationship
this
limited
locus
of
relational
possibility
expresses
one
limitation
of
possibility
inherent
in
the
general
system
of
the
process
of
realisation
whatever
possibility
is
generally
coherent
with
that
system
falls
within
this
limitation
also
whatever
is
abstractedly
possible
in
relation
to
the
general
course
of
eventsâ€”as
distinct
from
the
particular
limitations
introduced
by
particular
occasionsâ€”pervades
the
spatio-temporal
continuum
in
every
alternative
spatial
situation
and
at
all
alternative
times
fundamentally
the
spatio-temporal
continuum
is
the
general
system
of
relatedness
of
all
possibilities
in
so
far
as
that
system
is
limited
by
its
relevance
to
the
general
fact
of
actuality
also
it
is
inherent
in
the
nature
of
possibility
that
it
should
include
this
relevance
to
actuality
for
possibility
is
that
in
which
there
stands
achievability
abstracted
from
achievement
it
has
already
been
emphasised
that
an
actual
occasion
is
to
be
conceived
as
a
limitation
and
that
this
process
of
limitation
can
be
still
further
characterised
as
a
gradation
this
characteristic
of
an
actual
occasion
î±
say
requires
further
elucidation:
an
indeterminateness
stands
in
the
essence
of
any
eternal
object
î‘
say
the
actual
occasion
î±
synthesises
in
itself
every
eternal
object
and
in
so
doing
it
includes
the
complete
determinate
relatedness
of
î‘
to
every
other
eternal
object
or
set
of
eternal
objects
this
synthesis
is
a
limitation
of
realisation
but
not
of
content
each
relationship
preserves
its
inherent
self-identity
but
grades
of
entry
into
this
synthesis
are
inherent
in
each
actual
occasion
such
as
î±
these
grades
can
be
expressed
only
as
relevance
of
value
this
relevance
of
value
variesâ€”as
comparing
different
occasionsâ€”in
grade
from
the
inclusion
of
the
individual
essence
of
î‘
as
an
element
in
the
aesthetic
synthesis
in
some
grade
of
inclusion
to
the
lowest
grade
which
is
the
exclusion
of
the
individual
essence
of
î‘
as
an
element
in
the
aesthetic
synthesis
in
so
far
as
it
stands
in
this
lowest
grade
every
determinate
relationship
of
î‘
is
merely
ingredient
in
the
occasion
in
respect
to
the
determinate
how
this
relationship
is
an
unfulfilled
alternative
not
contributing
any
aesthetic
value
except
as
forming
an
element
in
the
systematic
substratum
of
unfulfilled
content
in
a
higher
grade
it
may
remain
unfulfilled
but
be
aesthetically
relevant
thus
a
conceived
merely
in
respect
to
its
relationships
to
other
eternal
objects
is
â€˜_a
conceived
as
not-being_â€™
where
â€˜not-beingâ€™
means
â€˜abstracted
from
the
determinate
fact
of
inclusions
in
and
exclusions
from
actual
events.â€™
also
â€˜_a
as
not-being
in
respect
to
a
definite
occasion
î±â€™
means
that
a
in
all
its
determinate
relationships
is
excluded
from
î±
again
â€˜_a
as
being
in
respect
to
î±â€™
means
that
a
in
some
of
its
determinate
relationships
is
included
in
î±
but
there
can
be
no
occasion
which
includes
a
in
all
its
determinate
relationships
for
some
of
these
relationships
are
contraries
thus
in
regard
to
excluded
relationships
a
will
be
not-being
in
î±
even
when
in
regard
to
other
relationships
a
will
be
being
in
î±
in
this
sense
every
occasion
is
a
synthesis
of
being
and
not-being
furthermore
though
some
eternal
objects
are
synthesised
in
an
occasion
î±
merely
quã¢
not-being
each
eternal
object
which
is
synthesised
quã¢
being
is
also
synthesised
quã¢
not-being
â€˜_being_â€™
here
means
â€˜individually
effective
in
the
aesthetic
synthesis.â€™
also
the
â€˜aesthetic
synthesisâ€™
is
the
â€˜experient
synthesisâ€™
viewed
as
self-creative
under
the
limitations
laid
upon
it
by
its
internal
relatedness
to
all
other
actual
occasions
we
thus
concludeâ€”what
has
already
been
stated
aboveâ€”that
the
general
fact
of
the
synthetic
prehension
of
all
eternal
objects
into
every
occasion
wears
the
double
aspect
of
the
indeterminate
relatedness
of
each
eternal
object
to
occasions
generally
and
of
its
determinate
relatedness
to
each
particular
occasion
this
statement
summarises
the
account
of
how
external
relations
are
possible
but
the
account
depends
upon
disengaging
the
spatio-temporal
continuum
from
its
mere
implication
in
actual
occasionsâ€”according
to
the
usual
explanationâ€”and
upon
exhibiting
it
in
its
origin
from
the
general
nature
of
abstract
possibility
as
limited
by
the
general
character
of
the
actual
course
of
events
the
difficulty
which
arises
in
respect
to
internal
relations
is
to
explain
how
any
particular
truth
is
possible
in
so
far
as
there
are
internal
relations
everything
must
depend
upon
everything
else
but
if
this
be
the
case
we
cannot
know
about
anything
till
we
equally
know
everything
else
apparently
therefore
we
are
under
the
necessity
of
saying
everything
at
once
this
supposed
necessity
is
palpably
untrue
accordingly
it
is
incumbent
on
us
to
explain
how
there
can
be
internal
relations
seeing
that
we
admit
finite
truths
since
actual
occasions
are
selections
from
the
realm
of
possibilities
the
ultimate
explanation
of
how
actual
occasions
have
the
general
character
which
they
do
have
must
lie
in
an
analysis
of
the
general
character
of
the
realm
of
possibility
the
analytical
character
of
the
realm
of
eternal
objects
is
the
primary
metaphysical
truth
concerning
it
by
this
character
it
is
meant
that
the
status
of
any
eternal
object
a
in
this
realm
is
capable
of
analysis
into
an
indefinite
number
of
subordinate
relationships
of
limited
scope
for
example
if
b
and
c
are
two
other
eternal
objects
then
there
is
some
perfectly
definite
relationship
r(a
b
c
which
involves
a
b
c
only
as
to
require
the
mention
of
no
other
definite
eternal
objects
in
the
capacity
of
relata
of
course
the
relationship
r(a
b
c
may
involve
subordinate
relationships
which
are
themselves
eternal
objects
and
r(a
b
c
is
also
itself
an
eternal
object
also
there
will
be
other
relationships
which
in
the
same
sense
involve
only
a
b
c
we
have
now
to
examine
how
having
regard
to
the
internal
relatedness
of
eternal
objects
this
limited
relationship
r(a
b
c
is
possible
the
reason
for
the
existence
of
finite
relationships
in
the
realm
of
eternal
objects
is
that
relationships
of
these
objects
among
themselves
are
entirely
unselective
and
are
systematically
complete
we
are
discussing
possibility
so
that
every
relationship
which
is
possible
is
thereby
in
the
realm
of
possibility
every
such
relationship
of
each
eternal
object
is
founded
upon
the
perfectly
definite
status
of
that
object
as
a
relatum
in
the
general
scheme
of
relationships
this
definite
status
is
what
i
have
termed
the
â€˜relational
essenceâ€™
of
the
object
this
relational
essence
is
determinable
by
reference
to
that
object
alone
and
does
not
require
reference
to
any
other
objects
except
those
which
are
specifically
involved
in
its
individual
essence
when
that
essence
is
complex
as
will
be
explained
immediately
the
meaning
of
the
words
â€˜anyâ€™
and
â€˜someâ€™
springs
from
this
principleâ€”that
is
to
say
the
meaning
of
the
â€˜variableâ€™
in
logic
the
whole
principle
is
that
a
particular
determination
can
be
made
of
the
how
of
some
definite
relationship
of
a
definite
eternal
object
a
to
a
definite
finite
number
n
of
other
eternal
objects
without
any
determination
of
the
other
n
objects
x1
x2

xn
except
that
they
have
each
of
them
the
requisite
status
to
play
their
respective
parts
in
that
multiple
relationship
this
principle
depends
on
the
fact
that
the
relational
essence
of
an
eternal
object
is
not
unique
to
that
object
the
mere
relational
essence
of
each
eternal
object
determines
the
complete
uniform
scheme
of
relational
essences
since
each
object
stands
internally
in
all
its
possible
relationships
thus
the
realm
of
possibility
provides
a
uniform
scheme
of
relationships
among
finite
sets
of
eternal
objects
and
all
eternal
objects
stand
in
all
such
relationships
so
far
as
the
status
of
each
permits
accordingly
the
relationships
as
in
possibility
do
not
involve
the
individual
essences
of
the
eternal
objects
they
involve
any
eternal
objects
as
relata
subject
to
the
proviso
that
these
relata
have
the
requisite
relational
essences
it
is
this
proviso
which
automatically
and
by
the
nature
of
the
case
limits
the
â€˜anyâ€™
of
the
phrase
â€˜any
eternal
objects.â€™
this
principle
is
the
principle
of
the
isolation
of
eternal
objects
in
the
realm
of
possibility
the
eternal
objects
are
isolated
because
their
relationships
as
possibilities
are
expressible
without
reference
to
their
respective
individual
essences
in
contrast
to
the
realm
of
possibility
the
inclusion
of
eternal
objects
within
an
actual
occasion
means
that
in
respect
to
some
of
their
possible
relationships
there
is
a
togetherness
of
their
individual
essences
this
realised
togetherness
is
the
achievement
of
an
emergent
value
definedâ€”or
shapedâ€”by
the
definite
eternal
relatedness
in
respect
to
which
the
real
togetherness
is
achieved
thus
the
eternal
relatedness
is
the
formâ€”the
îµá¼¶î´î¿ï‚â€”
the
emergent
actual
occasion
is
the
superject
of
informed
value
value
as
abstracted
from
any
particular
superject
is
the
abstract
matterâ€”the
á½•î»î·â€”which
is
common
to
all
actual
occasions
and
the
synthetic
activity
which
prehends
valueless
possibility
into
superjicient
informed
value
is
the
substantial
activity
this
substantial
activity
is
that
which
is
omitted
in
any
analysis
of
the
static
factors
in
the
metaphysical
situation
the
analysed
elements
of
the
situation
are
the
attributes
of
the
substantial
activity
the
difficulty
inherent
in
the
concept
of
finite
internal
relations
among
eternal
objects
is
thus
evaded
by
two
metaphysical
principles
i
that
the
relationships
of
any
eternal
object
a
considered
as
constitutive
of
a
merely
involve
other
eternal
objects
as
bare
relata
without
reference
to
their
individual
essences
and
ii
that
the
divisibility
of
the
general
relationship
of
a
into
a
multiplicity
of
finite
relationships
of
a
stands
therefore
in
the
essence
of
that
eternal
object
the
second
principle
obviously
depends
upon
the
first
to
understand
a
is
to
understand
the
how
of
a
general
scheme
of
relationship
this
scheme
of
relationship
does
not
require
the
individual
uniqueness
of
the
other
relata
for
its
comprehension
this
scheme
also
discloses
itself
as
being
analysable
into
a
multiplicity
of
limited
relationships
which
have
their
own
individuality
and
yet
at
the
same
time
presupposes
the
total
relationship
within
possibility
in
respect
to
actuality
there
is
first
the
general
limitation
of
relationships
which
reduces
this
general
unlimited
scheme
to
the
four
dimensional
spatio-temporal
scheme
this
spatio-temporal
scheme
is
so
to
speak
the
greatest
common
measure
of
the
schemes
of
relationship
as
limited
by
actuality
inherent
in
all
the
eternal
objects
by
this
it
is
meant
that
how
select
relationships
of
an
eternal
object
a
are
realised
in
any
actual
occasion
is
always
explicable
by
expressing
the
status
of
a
in
respect
to
this
spatio-temporal
scheme
and
by
expressing
in
this
scheme
the
relationship
of
the
actual
occasion
to
other
actual
occasions
a
definite
finite
relationship
involving
the
definite
eternal
objects
of
a
limited
set
of
such
objects
is
itself
an
eternal
object:
it
is
those
eternal
objects
as
in
that
relationship
i
will
call
such
an
eternal
object
â€˜complex.â€™
the
eternal
objects
which
are
the
relata
in
a
complex
eternal
object
will
be
called
the
â€˜componentsâ€™
of
that
eternal
object
also
if
any
of
these
relata
are
themselves
complex
their
components
will
be
called
â€˜derivative
componentsâ€™
of
the
original
complex
object
also
the
components
of
derivative
components
will
also
be
called
derivative
components
of
the
original
object
thus
the
complexity
of
an
eternal
object
means
its
analysability
into
a
relationship
of
component
eternal
objects
also
the
analysis
of
the
general
scheme
of
relatedness
of
eternal
objects
means
its
exhibition
as
a
multiplicity
of
complex
eternal
objects
an
eternal
object
such
as
a
definite
shade
of
green
which
cannot
be
analysed
into
a
relationship
of
components
will
be
called
â€˜simple.â€™
we
can
now
explain
how
the
analytical
character
of
the
realm
of
eternal
objects
allows
of
an
analysis
of
that
realm
into
grades
in
the
lowest
grade
of
eternal
objects
are
to
be
placed
those
objects
whose
individual
essences
are
simple
this
is
the
grade
of
zero
complexity
next
consider
any
set
of
such
objects
finite
or
infinite
as
to
the
number
of
its
members
for
example
consider
the
set
of
three
eternal
objects
a
b
c
of
which
none
is
complex
let
us
write
r(a
b
c
for
some
definite
possible
relatedness
of
a
b
c
to
take
a
simple
example
a
b
c
may
be
three
definite
colours
with
the
spatio-temporal
relatedness
to
each
other
of
three
faces
of
a
regular
tetrahedron
anywhere
at
any
time
then
r(a
b
c
is
another
eternal
object
of
the
lowest
complex
grade
analogously
there
are
eternal
objects
of
successively
higher
grades
in
respect
to
any
complex
eternal
object
s(d1
d2

dn
the
eternal
objects
d1

dn
whose
individual
essences
are
constitutive
of
the
individual
essence
of
s(d1

dn
are
called
the
components
of
s(d1

dn
it
is
obvious
that
the
grade
of
complexity
to
be
ascribed
to
s(d1

dn
is
to
be
taken
as
one
above
the
highest
grade
of
complexity
to
be
found
among
its
components
there
is
thus
an
analysis
of
the
realm
of
possibility
into
simple
eternal
objects
and
into
various
grades
of
complex
eternal
objects
a
complex
eternal
object
is
an
abstract
situation
there
is
a
double
sense
of
â€˜abstraction,â€™
in
regard
to
the
abstraction
of
definite
eternal
objects
i.e
non-mathematical
abstraction
there
is
abstraction
from
actuality
and
abstraction
from
possibility
for
example
a
and
r(a
b
c
are
both
abstractions
from
the
realm
of
possibility
note
that
a
must
mean
a
in
all
its
possible
relationships
and
among
them
r(a
b
c
also
r(a
b
c
means
r(a
b
c
in
all
its
relationships
but
this
meaning
of
r(a
b
c
excludes
other
relationships
into
which
a
can
enter
hence
a
as
in
r(a
b
c
is
more
abstract
than
a
simpliciter
thus
as
we
pass
from
the
grade
of
simple
eternal
objects
to
higher
and
higher
grades
of
complexity
we
are
indulging
in
higher
grades
of
abstraction
from
the
realm
of
possibility
we
can
now
conceive
the
successive
stages
of
a
definite
progress
towards
some
assigned
mode
of
abstraction
from
the
realm
of
possibility
involving
a
progress
in
thought
through
successive
grades
of
increasing
complexity
i
will
call
any
such
route
of
progress
â€˜an
abstractive
hierarchy.â€™
any
abstractive
hierarchy
finite
or
infinite
is
based
upon
some
definite
group
of
simple
eternal
objects
this
group
will
be
called
the
â€˜baseâ€™
of
the
hierarchy
thus
the
base
of
an
abstractive
hierarchy
is
a
set
of
objects
of
zero
complexity
the
formal
definition
of
an
abstractive
hierarchy
is
as
follows:
an
â€˜abstractive
hierarchy
based
upon
g_,â€™
where
g
is
a
group
of
simple
eternal
objects
is
a
set
of
eternal
objects
which
satisfy
the
following
conditions
i
the
members
of
g
belong
to
it
and
are
the
only
simple
eternal
objects
in
the
hierarchy
ii
the
components
of
any
complex
eternal
object
in
the
hierarchy
are
also
members
of
the
hierarchy
and
iii
any
set
of
eternal
objects
belonging
to
the
hierarchy
whether
all
of
the
same
grade
or
whether
differing
among
themselves
as
to
grade
are
jointly
among
the
components
or
derivative
components
of
at
least
one
eternal
object
which
also
belongs
to
the
hierarchy
it
is
to
be
noticed
that
the
components
of
an
eternal
object
are
necessarily
of
a
lower
grade
of
complexity
than
itself
accordingly
any
member
of
such
a
hierarchy
which
is
of
the
first
grade
of
complexity
can
have
as
components
only
members
of
the
group
g
and
any
member
of
the
second
grade
can
have
as
components
only
members
of
the
first
grade
and
members
of
g
and
so
on
for
the
higher
grades
the
third
condition
to
be
satisfied
by
an
abstractive
hierarchy
will
be
called
the
condition
of
connexity
thus
an
abstractive
hierarchy
springs
from
its
base
it
includes
every
successive
grade
from
its
base
either
indefinitely
onwards
or
to
its
maximum
grade
and
it
is
â€˜connectedâ€™
by
the
reappearance
in
a
higher
grade
of
any
set
of
its
members
belonging
to
lower
grades
in
the
function
of
a
set
of
components
or
derivative
components
of
at
least
one
member
of
the
hierarchy
an
abstractive
hierarchy
is
called
â€˜finiteâ€™
if
it
stops
at
a
finite
grade
of
complexity
it
is
called
â€˜infiniteâ€™
if
it
includes
members
belonging
respectively
to
all
degrees
of
complexity
it
is
to
be
noted
that
the
base
of
an
abstractive
hierarchy
may
contain
any
number
of
members
finite
or
infinite
further
the
infinity
of
the
number
of
the
members
of
the
base
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
as
to
whether
the
hierarchy
be
finite
or
infinite
a
finite
abstractive
hierarchy
will
by
definition
possess
a
grade
of
maximum
complexity
it
is
characteristic
of
this
grade
that
a
member
of
it
is
a
component
of
no
other
eternal
object
belonging
to
any
grade
of
the
hierarchy
also
it
is
evident
that
this
grade
of
maximum
complexity
must
possess
only
one
member
for
otherwise
the
condition
of
connexity
would
not
be
satisfied
conversely
any
complex
eternal
object
defines
a
finite
abstractive
hierarchy
to
be
discovered
by
a
process
of
analysis
this
complex
eternal
object
from
which
we
start
will
be
called
the
â€˜vertexâ€™
of
the
abstractive
hierarchy:
it
is
the
sole
member
of
the
grade
of
maximum
complexity
in
the
first
stage
of
the
analysis
we
obtain
the
components
of
the
vertex
these
components
may
be
of
varying
complexity
but
there
must
be
among
them
at
least
one
member
whose
complexity
is
of
a
grade
one
lower
than
that
of
the
vertex
a
grade
which
is
one
lower
than
that
of
a
given
eternal
object
will
be
called
the
â€˜proximate
gradeâ€™
for
that
object
we
take
then
those
components
of
the
vertex
which
belong
to
its
proximate
grade
and
as
the
second
stage
we
analyse
them
into
their
components
among
these
components
there
must
be
some
belonging
to
the
proximate
grade
for
the
objects
thus
analysed
add
to
them
the
components
of
the
vertex
which
also
belong
to
this
grade
of
â€˜second
proximationâ€™
from
the
vertex
and
at
the
third
stage
analyse
as
before
we
thus
find
objects
belonging
to
the
grade
of
third
proximation
from
the
vertex
and
we
add
to
them
the
components
belonging
to
this
grade
which
have
been
left
over
from
the
preceding
stages
of
the
analysis
we
proceed
in
this
way
through
successive
stages
till
we
reach
the
grade
of
simple
objects
this
grade
forms
the
base
of
the
hierarchy
it
is
to
be
noted
that
in
dealing
with
hierarchies
we
are
entirely
within
the
realm
of
possibility
accordingly
the
eternal
objects
are
devoid
of
real
togetherness:
they
remain
within
their
â€˜isolation.â€™
the
logical
instrument
which
aristotle
used
for
the
analysis
of
actual
fact
into
more
abstract
elements
was
that
of
classification
into
species
and
genera
this
instrument
has
its
overwhelmingly
important
application
for
science
in
its
preparatory
stages
but
its
use
in
metaphysical
description
distorts
the
true
vision
of
the
metaphysical
situation
the
use
of
the
term
â€˜universalâ€™
is
intimately
connected
with
this
aristotelian
analysis:
the
term
has
been
broadened
of
late
but
still
it
suggests
that
classificatory
analysis
for
this
reason
i
have
avoided
it
in
any
actual
occasion
î±
there
will
be
a
group
g
of
simple
eternal
objects
which
are
ingredient
in
that
group
in
the
most
concrete
mode
this
complete
ingredience
in
an
occasion
so
as
to
yield
the
most
complete
fusion
of
individual
essence
with
other
eternal
objects
in
the
formation
of
the
individual
emergent
occasion
is
evidently
of
its
own
kind
and
cannot
be
defined
in
terms
of
anything
else
but
it
has
a
peculiar
characteristic
which
necessarily
attaches
to
it
this
characteristic
is
that
there
is
an
infinite
abstractive
hierarchy
based
upon
g
which
is
such
that
all
its
members
are
equally
involved
in
this
complete
inclusion
in
î±
the
existence
of
such
an
infinite
abstractive
hierarchy
is
what
is
meant
by
the
statement
that
it
is
impossible
to
complete
the
description
of
an
actual
occasion
by
means
of
concepts
i
will
call
this
infinite
abstractive
hierarchy
which
is
associated
with
î±
â€˜the
associated
hierarchy
of
î±.â€™
it
is
also
what
is
meant
by
the
notion
of
the
connectedness
of
an
actual
occasion
this
connectedness
of
an
occasion
is
necessary
for
its
synthetic
unity
and
for
its
intelligibility
there
is
a
connected
hierarchy
of
concepts
applicable
to
the
occasion
including
concepts
of
all
degrees
of
complexity
also
in
the
actual
occasion
the
individual
essences
of
the
eternal
objects
involved
in
these
complex
concepts
achieve
an
aesthetic
synthesis
productive
of
the
occasion
as
an
experience
for
its
own
sake
this
associated
hierarchy
is
the
shape
or
pattern
or
form
of
the
occasion
in
so
far
as
the
occasion
is
constituted
of
what
enters
into
its
full
realisation
some
confusion
of
thought
has
been
caused
by
the
fact
that
abstraction
from
possibility
runs
in
the
opposite
direction
to
an
abstraction
from
actuality
so
far
as
degree
of
abstractness
is
concerned
for
evidently
in
describing
an
actual
occasion
î±
we
are
nearer
to
the
total
concrete
fact
when
we
describe
î±
by
predicating
of
it
some
member
of
its
associated
hierarchy
which
is
of
a
high
grade
of
complexity
we
have
then
said
more
about
î±
thus
with
a
high
grade
of
complexity
we
gain
in
approach
to
the
full
concreteness
of
î±
and
with
a
low
grade
we
lose
in
this
approach
accordingly
the
simple
eternal
objects
represent
the
extreme
of
abstraction
from
an
actual
occasion
whereas
simple
eternal
objects
represent
the
minimum
of
abstraction
from
the
realm
of
possibility
it
will
i
think
be
found
that
when
a
high
degree
of
abstraction
is
spoken
of
abstraction
from
the
realm
of
possibility
is
what
is
usually
meantâ€”in
other
words
an
elaborate
logical
construction
so
far
i
have
merely
been
considering
an
actual
occasion
on
the
side
of
its
full
concreteness
it
is
this
side
of
the
occasion
in
virtue
of
which
it
is
an
event
in
nature
but
a
natural
event
in
this
sense
of
the
term
is
only
an
abstraction
from
a
complete
actual
occasion
a
complete
occasion
includes
that
which
in
cognitive
experience
takes
the
form
of
memory
anticipation
imagination
and
thought
these
elements
in
an
experient
occasion
are
also
modes
of
inclusion
of
complex
eternal
objects
in
the
synthetic
prehension
as
elements
in
the
emergent
value
they
differ
from
the
concreteness
of
full
inclusion
in
a
sense
this
difference
is
inexplicable
for
each
mode
of
inclusion
is
of
its
own
kind
not
to
be
explained
in
terms
of
anything
else
but
there
is
a
common
difference
which
discriminates
these
modes
of
inclusion
from
the
full
concrete
ingression
which
has
been
discussed
this
differentia
is
abruptness
by
â€˜abruptnessâ€™
i
mean
that
what
is
remembered
or
anticipated
or
imagined
or
thought
is
exhausted
by
a
finite
complex
concept
in
each
case
there
is
one
finite
eternal
object
prehended
within
the
occasion
as
the
vertex
of
a
finite
hierarchy
this
breaking
off
from
an
actual
illimitability
is
what
in
any
occasion
marks
off
that
which
is
termed
mental
from
that
which
belongs
to
the
physical
event
to
which
the
mental
functioning
is
referred
in
general
there
seems
to
be
some
loss
of
vividness
in
the
apprehension
of
the
eternal
objects
concerned:
for
example
hume
speaks
of
â€˜faint
copies.â€™
but
this
faintness
seems
to
be
a
very
unsafe
ground
for
differentiation
often
things
realised
in
thought
are
more
vivid
than
the
same
things
in
inattentive
physical
experience
but
the
things
apprehended
as
mental
are
always
subject
to
the
condition
that
we
come
to
a
stop
when
we
attempt
to
explore
ever
higher
grades
of
complexity
in
their
realised
relationships
we
always
find
that
we
have
thought
of
just
thisâ€”whatever
it
may
beâ€”and
of
no
more
there
is
a
limitation
which
breaks
off
the
finite
concept
from
the
higher
grades
of
illimitable
complexity
thus
an
actual
occasion
is
a
prehension
of
one
infinite
hierarchy
its
associated
hierarchy
together
with
various
finite
hierarchies
the
synthesis
into
the
occasion
of
the
infinite
hierarchy
is
according
to
its
specific
mode
of
realisation
and
that
of
the
finite
hierarchies
is
according
to
various
other
specific
modes
of
realisation
there
is
one
metaphysical
principle
which
is
essential
for
the
rational
coherence
of
this
account
of
the
general
character
of
an
experient
occasion
i
call
this
principle
â€˜the
translucency
of
realisation.â€™
by
this
i
mean
that
any
eternal
object
is
just
itself
in
whatever
mode
of
realisation
it
is
involved
there
can
be
no
distortion
of
the
individual
essence
without
thereby
producing
a
different
eternal
object
in
the
essence
of
each
eternal
object
there
stands
an
indeterminateness
which
expresses
its
indifferent
patience
for
any
mode
of
ingression
into
any
actual
occasion
thus
in
cognitive
experience
there
can
be
the
cognition
of
the
same
eternal
object
as
in
the
same
occasion
having
ingression
with
implication
in
more
than
one
grade
of
realisation
thus
the
translucency
of
realisation
and
the
possible
multiplicity
of
modes
of
ingression
into
the
same
occasion
together
form
the
foundation
for
the
correspondence
theory
of
truth
in
this
account
of
an
actual
occasion
in
terms
of
its
connection
with
the
realm
of
eternal
objects
we
have
gone
back
to
the
train
of
thought
in
our
second
chapter
where
the
nature
of
mathematics
was
discussed
the
idea
ascribed
to
pythagoras
has
been
amplified
and
put
forward
as
the
first
chapter
in
metaphysics
the
next
chapter
is
concerned
with
the
puzzling
fact
that
there
is
an
actual
course
of
events
which
is
in
itself
a
limited
fact
in
that
metaphysically
speaking
it
might
have
been
otherwise
but
other
metaphysical
investigations
are
omitted
for
example
epistemology
and
the
classification
of
some
elements
in
the
unfathomable
wealth
of
the
field
of
possibility
this
last
topic
brings
metaphysics
in
sight
of
the
special
topics
of
the
various
sciences
chapter
xi
god
aristotle
found
it
necessary
to
complete
his
metaphysics
by
the
introduction
of
a
prime
moverâ€”god
this
for
two
reasons
is
an
important
fact
in
the
history
of
metaphysics
in
the
first
place
if
we
are
to
accord
to
anyone
the
position
of
the
greatest
metaphysician
having
regard
to
genius
of
insight
to
general
equipment
in
knowledge
and
to
the
stimulus
of
his
metaphysical
ancestry
we
must
choose
aristotle
secondly
in
his
consideration
of
this
metaphysical
question
he
was
entirely
dispassionate
and
he
is
the
last
european
metaphysician
of
first
rate
importance
for
whom
this
claim
can
be
made
after
aristotle
ethical
and
religious
interests
began
to
influence
metaphysical
conclusions
the
jews
dispersed
first
willingly
and
then
forcibly
and
the
judaic-alexandrian
school
arose
then
christianity
closely
followed
by
mahometanism
intervened
the
greek
gods
who
surrounded
aristotle
were
subordinate
metaphysical
entities
well
within
nature
accordingly
on
the
subject
of
his
prime
mover
he
would
have
no
motive
except
to
follow
his
metaphysical
train
of
thought
whithersoever
it
led
him
it
did
not
lead
him
very
far
towards
the
production
of
a
god
available
for
religious
purposes
it
may
be
doubted
whether
any
properly
general
metaphysics
can
ever
without
the
illicit
introduction
of
other
considerations
get
much
further
than
aristotle
but
his
conclusion
does
represent
a
first
step
without
which
no
evidence
on
a
narrower
experiential
basis
can
be
of
much
avail
in
shaping
the
conception
for
nothing
within
any
limited
type
of
experience
can
give
intelligence
to
shape
our
ideas
of
any
entity
at
the
base
of
all
actual
things
unless
the
general
character
of
things
requires
that
there
be
such
an
entity
the
phrase
prime
mover
warns
us
that
aristotleâ€™s
thought
was
enmeshed
in
the
details
of
an
erroneous
physics
and
an
erroneous
cosmology
in
aristotleâ€™s
physics
special
causes
were
required
to
sustain
the
motions
of
material
things
these
could
easily
be
fitted
into
his
system
provided
that
the
general
cosmic
motions
could
be
sustained
for
then
in
relation
to
the
general
working
system
each
thing
could
be
provided
with
its
true
end
hence
the
necessity
for
a
prime
mover
who
sustains
the
motions
of
the
spheres
on
which
depend
the
adjustment
of
things
to-day
we
repudiate
the
aristotelian
physics
and
the
aristotelian
cosmology
so
that
the
exact
form
of
the
above
argument
manifestly
fails
but
if
our
general
metaphysics
is
in
any
way
similar
to
that
outlined
in
the
previous
chapter
an
analogous
metaphysical
problem
arises
which
can
be
solved
only
in
an
analogous
fashion
in
the
place
of
aristotleâ€™s
god
as
prime
mover
we
require
god
as
the
principle
of
concretion
this
position
can
be
substantiated
only
by
the
discussion
of
the
general
implication
of
the
course
of
actual
occasions,â€”that
is
to
say
of
the
process
of
realisation
we
conceive
actuality
as
in
essential
relation
to
an
unfathomable
possibility
eternal
objects
inform
actual
occasions
with
hierarchic
patterns
included
and
excluded
in
every
variety
of
discrimination
another
view
of
the
same
truth
is
that
every
actual
occasion
is
a
limitation
imposed
on
possibility
and
that
by
virtue
of
this
limitation
the
particular
value
of
that
shaped
togetherness
of
things
emerges
in
this
way
we
express
how
a
single
occasion
is
to
be
viewed
in
terms
of
possibility
and
how
possibility
is
to
be
viewed
in
terms
of
a
single
actual
occasion
but
there
are
no
single
occasions
in
the
sense
of
isolated
occasions
actuality
is
through
and
through
togethernessâ€”togetherness
of
otherwise
isolated
eternal
objects
and
togetherness
of
all
actual
occasions
it
is
my
task
in
this
chapter
to
describe
the
unity
of
actual
occasions
the
previous
chapter
centered
its
interest
in
the
abstract:
the
present
chapter
deals
with
the
concrete
i.e
that
which
has
grown
together
consider
an
occasion
î±:â€”we
have
to
enumerate
how
other
actual
occasions
are
in
î±
in
the
sense
that
their
relationships
with
î±
are
constitutive
of
the
essence
of
î±
what
î±
is
in
itself
is
that
it
is
a
unit
of
realised
experience
accordingly
we
ask
how
other
occasions
are
in
the
experience
which
is
î±
also
for
the
present
i
am
excluding
cognitive
experience
the
complete
answer
to
this
question
is
that
the
relationships
among
actual
occasions
are
as
unfathomable
in
their
variety
of
type
as
are
those
among
eternal
objects
in
the
realm
of
abstraction
but
there
are
fundamental
types
of
such
relationships
in
terms
of
which
the
whole
complex
variety
can
find
its
description
a
preliminary
for
the
understanding
of
these
types
of
entry
of
one
occasion
into
the
essence
of
another
is
to
note
that
they
are
involved
in
the
modes
of
realisation
of
abstractive
hierarchies
discussed
in
the
previous
chapter
the
spatio-temporal
relationships
involved
in
those
hierarchies
as
realised
in
î±
have
all
a
definition
in
terms
of
î±
and
of
the
occasions
entrant
in
î±
thus
the
entrant
occasions
lend
their
aspects
to
the
hierarchies
and
thereby
convert
spatio-temporal
modalities
into
categorical
determinations
and
the
hierarchies
lend
their
forms
to
the
occasions
and
thereby
limit
the
entrant
occasions
to
being
entrant
only
under
those
forms
thus
in
the
same
way
as
seen
in
the
previous
chapter
that
every
occasion
is
a
synthesis
of
all
eternal
objects
under
the
limitation
of
gradations
of
actuality
so
every
occasion
is
a
synthesis
of
all
occasions
under
the
limitation
of
gradations
of
types
of
entry
each
occasion
synthesises
the
totality
of
content
under
its
own
limitations
of
mode
in
respect
to
these
types
of
internal
relationship
between
î±
and
other
occasions
these
other
occasions
as
constitutive
of
î±
can
be
classified
in
many
alternative
ways
these
are
all
concerned
with
different
definitions
of
past
present
and
future
it
has
been
usual
in
philosophy
to
assume
that
these
various
definitions
must
necessarily
be
equivalent
the
present
state
of
opinion
in
physical
science
conclusively
shows
that
this
assumption
is
without
metaphysical
justification
even
though
any
such
discrimination
may
be
found
to
be
unnecessary
for
physical
science
this
question
has
already
been
dealt
with
in
the
chapter
on
relativity
but
the
physical
theory
of
relativity
touches
only
the
fringe
of
the
various
theories
which
are
metaphysically
tenable
it
is
important
for
my
argument
to
insist
upon
the
unbounded
freedom
within
which
the
actual
is
a
unique
categorical
determination
every
actual
occasion
exhibits
itself
as
a
process:
it
is
a
becomingness
in
so
disclosing
itself
it
places
itself
as
one
among
a
multiplicity
of
other
occasions
without
which
it
could
not
be
itself
it
also
defines
itself
as
a
particular
individual
achievement
focussing
in
its
limited
way
an
unbounded
realm
of
eternal
objects
any
one
occasion
î±
issues
from
other
occasions
which
collectively
form
its
past
it
displays
for
itself
other
occasions
which
collectively
form
its
present
it
is
in
respect
to
its
associated
hierarchy
as
displayed
in
this
immediate
present
that
an
occasion
finds
its
own
originality
it
is
that
display
which
is
its
own
contribution
to
the
output
of
actuality
it
may
be
conditioned
and
even
completely
determined
by
the
past
from
which
it
issues
but
its
display
in
the
present
under
those
conditions
is
what
directly
emerges
from
its
prehensive
activity
the
occasion
î±
also
holds
within
itself
an
indetermination
in
the
form
of
a
future
which
has
partial
determination
by
reason
of
its
inclusion
in
î±
and
also
has
determinate
spatio-temporal
relatedness
to
î±
and
to
actual
occasions
of
the
past
from
î±
and
of
the
present
for
î±
this
future
is
a
synthesis
in
î±
of
eternal
objects
as
not-being
and
as
requiring
the
passage
from
î±
to
other
individualisations
with
determinate
spatio-temporal
relations
to
î±
in
which
not-being
becomes
being
there
is
also
in
î±
what
in
the
previous
chapter
i
have
termed
the
â€˜abruptâ€™
realisation
of
finite
eternal
objects
this
abrupt
realisation
requires
either
a
reference
of
the
basic
objects
of
the
finite
hierarchy
to
determinate
occasions
other
than
î±
as
their
situations
in
past
present
future
or
requires
a
realisation
of
these
eternal
objects
in
determinate
relationships
but
under
the
aspect
of
exemption
from
inclusion
in
the
spatio-temporal
scheme
of
relatedness
between
actual
occasions
this
abrupt
synthesis
of
eternal
objects
in
each
occasion
is
the
inclusion
in
actuality
of
the
analytical
character
of
the
realm
of
eternality
this
inclusion
has
those
limited
gradations
of
actuality
which
characterise
every
occasion
by
reason
of
its
essential
limitation
it
is
this
realised
extension
of
eternal
relatedness
beyond
the
mutual
relatedness
of
the
actual
occasions
which
prehends
into
each
occasion
the
full
sweep
of
eternal
relatedness
i
term
this
abrupt
realisation
the
â€˜graded
envisagementâ€™
which
each
occasion
prehends
into
its
synthesis
this
graded
envisagement
is
how
the
actual
includes
what
in
one
sense
is
not-being
as
a
positive
factor
in
its
own
achievement
it
is
the
source
of
error
of
truth
of
art
of
ethics
and
of
religion
by
it
fact
is
confronted
with
alternatives
this
general
concept
of
an
event
as
a
process
whose
outcome
is
a
unit
of
experience
points
to
the
analysis
of
an
event
into
i
substantial
activity
ii
conditioned
potentialities
which
are
there
for
synthesis
and
iii
the
achieved
outcome
of
the
synthesis
the
unity
of
all
actual
occasions
forbids
the
analysis
of
substantial
activities
into
independent
entities
each
individual
activity
is
nothing
but
the
mode
in
which
the
general
activity
is
individualised
by
the
imposed
conditions
the
envisagement
which
enters
into
the
synthesis
is
also
a
character
which
conditions
the
synthesising
activity
the
general
activity
is
not
an
entity
in
the
sense
in
which
occasions
or
eternal
objects
are
entities
it
is
a
general
metaphysical
character
which
underlies
all
occasions
in
a
particular
mode
for
each
occasion
there
is
nothing
with
which
to
compare
it:
it
is
spinozaâ€™s
one
infinite
substance
its
attributes
are
its
character
of
individualisation
into
a
multiplicity
of
modes
and
the
realm
of
eternal
objects
which
are
variously
synthesised
in
these
modes
thus
eternal
possibility
and
modal
differentiation
into
individual
multiplicity
are
the
attributes
of
the
one
substance
in
fact
each
general
element
of
the
metaphysical
situation
is
an
attribute
of
the
substantial
activity
yet
another
element
in
the
metaphysical
situation
is
disclosed
by
the
consideration
that
the
general
attribute
of
modality
is
limited
this
element
must
rank
as
an
attribute
of
the
substantial
activity
in
its
nature
each
mode
is
limited
so
as
not
to
be
other
modes
but
beyond
these
limitations
of
particulars
the
general
modal
individualisation
is
limited
in
two
ways:
in
the
first
place
it
is
an
actual
course
of
events
which
might
be
otherwise
so
far
as
concerns
eternal
possibility
but
is
that
course
this
limitation
takes
three
forms
i
the
special
logical
relations
which
all
events
must
conform
to
ii
the
selection
of
relationships
to
which
the
events
do
conform
and
iii
the
particularity
which
infects
the
course
even
within
those
general
relationships
of
logic
and
causation
thus
this
first
limitation
is
a
limitation
of
antecedent
selection
so
far
as
the
general
metaphysical
situation
is
concerned
there
might
have
been
an
indiscriminate
modal
pluralism
apart
from
logical
or
other
limitation
but
there
could
not
then
have
been
these
modes
for
each
mode
represents
a
synthesis
of
actualities
which
are
limited
to
conform
to
a
standard
we
here
come
to
the
second
way
of
limitation
restriction
is
the
price
of
value
there
cannot
be
value
without
antecedent
standards
of
value
to
discriminate
the
acceptance
or
rejection
of
what
is
before
the
envisaging
mode
of
activity
thus
there
is
an
antecedent
limitation
among
values
introducing
contraries
grades
and
oppositions
according
to
this
argument
the
fact
that
there
is
a
process
of
actual
occasions
and
the
fact
that
the
occasions
are
the
emergence
of
values
which
require
such
limitation
both
require
that
the
course
of
events
should
have
developed
amid
an
antecedent
limitation
composed
of
conditions
particularisation
and
standards
of
value
thus
as
a
further
element
in
the
metaphysical
situation
there
is
required
a
principle
of
limitation
some
particular
how
is
necessary
and
some
particularisation
in
the
what
of
matter
of
fact
is
necessary
the
only
alternative
to
this
admission
is
to
deny
the
reality
of
actual
occasions
their
apparent
irrational
limitation
must
be
taken
as
a
proof
of
illusion
and
we
must
look
for
reality
behind
the
scene
if
we
reject
this
alternative
behind
the
scene
we
must
provide
a
ground
for
limitation
which
stands
among
the
attributes
of
the
substantial
activity
this
attribute
provides
the
limitation
for
which
no
reason
can
be
given:
for
all
reason
flows
from
it
god
is
the
ultimate
limitation
and
his
existence
is
the
ultimate
irrationality
for
no
reason
can
be
given
for
just
that
limitation
which
it
stands
in
his
nature
to
impose
god
is
not
concrete
but
he
is
the
ground
for
concrete
actuality
no
reason
can
be
given
for
the
nature
of
god
because
that
nature
is
the
ground
of
rationality
in
this
argument
the
point
to
notice
is
that
what
is
metaphysically
indeterminate
has
nevertheless
to
be
categorically
determinate
we
have
come
to
the
limit
of
rationality
for
there
is
a
categorical
limitation
which
does
not
spring
from
any
metaphysical
reason
there
is
a
metaphysical
need
for
a
principle
of
determination
but
there
can
be
no
metaphysical
reason
for
what
is
determined
if
there
were
such
a
reason
there
would
be
no
need
for
any
further
principle:
for
metaphysics
would
already
have
provided
the
determination
the
general
principle
of
empiricism
depends
upon
the
doctrine
that
there
is
a
principle
of
concretion
which
is
not
discoverable
by
abstract
reason
what
further
can
be
known
about
god
must
be
sought
in
the
region
of
particular
experiences
and
therefore
rests
on
an
empirical
basis
in

to
the
interpretation

religion
and
science
the
difficulty
in
approaching
the
question
of
the
relations
between
religion
and
science
is
that
its
elucidation
requires
that
we
have
in
our
minds
some
clear
idea
of
what
we
mean
by
either
of
the
terms
â€˜religionâ€™
and
â€˜science.â€™
also
i
wish
to
speak
in
the
most
general
way
possible
and
to
keep
in
the
background
any
comparison
of
particular
creeds
scientific
or
religious
we
have
got
to
understand
the
type
of
connection
which
exists
between
the
two
spheres
and
then
to
draw
some
definite
conclusions
respecting
the
existing
situation
which
at
present
confronts
the
world
the
conflict
between
religion
and
science
is
what
naturally
occurs
to
our
minds
when
we
think
of
this
subject
it
seems
as
though
during
the
last
half-century
the
results
of
science
and
the
beliefs
of
religion
had
come
into
a
position
of
frank
disagreement
from
which
there
can
be
no
escape
except
by
abandoning
either
the
clear
teaching
of
science
or
the
clear
teaching
of
religion
this
conclusion
has
been
urged
by
controversialists
on
either
side
not
by
all
controversialists
of
course
but
by
those
trenchant
intellects
which
every
controversy
calls
out
into
the
open
the
distress
of
sensitive
minds
and
the
zeal
for
truth
and
the
sense
of
the
importance
of
the
issues
must
command
our
sincerest
sympathy
when
we
consider
what
religion
is
for
mankind
and
what
science
is
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
the
future
course
of
history
depends
upon
the
decision
of
this
generation
as
to
the
relations
between
them
we
have
here
the
two
strongest
general
forces
apart
from
the
mere
impulse
of
the
various
senses
which
influence
men
and
they
seem
to
be
set
one
against
the
otherâ€”the
force
of
our
religious
intuitions
and
the
force
of
our
impulse
to
accurate
observation
and
logical
deduction
a
great
english
statesman
once
advised
his
countrymen
to
use
large-scale
maps
as
a
preservative
against
alarms
panics
and
general
misunderstanding
of
the
true
relations
between
nations
in
the
same
way
in
dealing
with
the
clash
between
permanent
elements
of
human
nature
it
is
well
to
map
our
history
on
a
large
scale
and
to
disengage
ourselves
from
our
immediate
absorption
in
the
present
conflicts
when
we
do
this
we
immediately
discover
two
great
facts
in
the
first
place
there
has
always
been
a
conflict
between
religion
and
science
and
in
the
second
place
both
religion
and
science
have
always
been
in
a
state
of
continual
development
in
the
early
days
of
christianity
there
was
a
general
belief
among
christians
that
the
world
was
coming
to
an
end
in
the
lifetime
of
people
then
living
we
can
make
only
indirect
inferences
as
to
how
far
this
belief
was
authoritatively
proclaimed
but
it
is
certain
that
it
was
widely
held
and
that
it
formed
an
impressive
part
of
the
popular
religious
doctrine
the
belief
proved
itself
to
be
mistaken
and
christian
doctrine
adjusted
itself
to
the
change
again
in
the
early
church
individual
theologians
very
confidently
deduced
from
the
bible
opinions
concerning
the
nature
of
the
physical
universe
in
the
year
a
d
535
a
monk
named
cosmas[17
wrote
a
book
which
he
entitled
christian
topography
he
was
a
travelled
man
who
had
visited
india
and
ethiopia
and
finally
he
lived
in
a
monastery
at
alexandria
which
was
then
a
great
centre
of
culture
in
this
book
basing
himself
upon
the
direct
meaning
of
biblical
texts
as
construed
by
him
in
a
literal
fashion
he
denied
the
existence
of
the
antipodes
and
asserted
that
the
world
is
a
flat
parallelogram
whose
length
is
double
its
breadth

leckyâ€™s
the
rise
and
influence
of
rationalism
in
europe
ch
iii
in
the
seventeenth
century
the
doctrine
of
the
motion
of
the
earth
was
condemned
by
a
catholic
tribunal
a
hundred
years
ago
the
extension
of
time
demanded
by
geological
science
distressed
religious
people
protestant
and
catholic
and
to-day
the
doctrine
of
evolution
is
an
equal
stumbling-block
these
are
only
a
few
instances
illustrating
a
general
fact
but
all
our
ideas
will
be
in
a
wrong
perspective
if
we
think
that
this
recurring
perplexity
was
confined
to
contradictions
between
religion
and
science
and
that
in
these
controversies
religion
was
always
wrong
and
that
science
was
always
right
the
true
facts
of
the
case
are
very
much
more
complex
and
refuse
to
be
summarised
in
these
simple
terms
theology
itself
exhibits
exactly
the
same
character
of
gradual
development
arising
from
an
aspect
of
conflict
between
its
own
proper
ideas
this
fact
is
a
commonplace
to
theologians
but
is
often
obscured
in
the
stress
of
controversy
i
do
not
wish
to
overstate
my
case
so
i
will
confine
myself
to
roman
catholic
writers
in
the
seventeenth
century
a
learned
jesuit
father
petavius
showed
that
the
theologians
of
the
first
three
centuries
of
christianity
made
use
of
phrases
and
statements
which
since
the
fifth
century
would
be
condemned
as
heretical
also
cardinal
newman
devoted
a
treatise
to
the
discussion
of
the
development
of
doctrine
he
wrote
it
before
he
became
a
great
roman
catholic
ecclesiastic
but
throughout
his
life
it
was
never
retracted
and
continually
reissued
science
is
even
more
changeable
than
theology
no
man
of
science
could
subscribe
without
qualification
to
galileoâ€™s
beliefs
or
to
newtonâ€™s
beliefs
or
to
all
his
own
scientific
beliefs
of
ten
years
ago
in
both
regions
of
thought
additions
distinctions
and
modifications
have
been
introduced
so
that
now
even
when
the
same
assertion
is
made
to-day
as
was
made
a
thousand
or
fifteen
hundred
years
ago
it
is
made
subject
to
limitations
or
expansions
of
meaning
which
were
not
contemplated
at
the
earlier
epoch
we
are
told
by
logicians
that
a
proposition
must
be
either
true
or
false
and
that
there
is
no
middle
term
but
in
practice
we
may
know
that
a
proposition
expresses
an
important
truth
but
that
it
is
subject
to
limitations
and
qualifications
which
at
present
remain
undiscovered
it
is
a
general
feature
of
our
knowledge
that
we
are
insistently
aware
of
important
truths
and
yet
that
the
only
formulations
of
these
truths
which
we
are
able
to
make
presuppose
a
general
standpoint
of
conceptions
which
may
have
to
be
modified
i
will
give
you
two
illustrations
both
from
science:
galileo
said
that
the
earth
moves
and
that
the
sun
is
fixed
the
inquisition
said
that
the
earth
is
fixed
and
the
sun
moves
and
newtonian
astronomers
adopting
an
absolute
theory
of
space
said
that
both
the
sun
and
the
earth
move
but
now
we
say
that
any
one
of
these
three
statements
is
equally
true
provided
that
you
have
fixed
your
sense
of
â€˜restâ€™
and
â€˜motionâ€™
in
the
way
required
by
the
statement
adopted
at
the
date
of
galileoâ€™s
controversy
with
the
inquisition
galileoâ€™s
way
of
stating
the
facts
was
beyond
question
the
fruitful
procedure
for
the
sake
of
scientific
research
but
in
itself
it
was
not
more
true
than
the
formulation
of
the
inquisition
but
at
that
time
the
modern
concepts
of
relative
motion
were
in
nobodyâ€™s
mind
so
that
the
statements
were
made
in
ignorance
of
the
qualifications
required
for
their
more
perfect
truth
yet
this
question
of
the
motions
of
the
earth
and
the
sun
expresses
a
real
fact
in
the
universe
and
all
sides
had
got
hold
of
important
truths
concerning
it
but
with
the
knowledge
of
those
times
the
truths
appeared
to
be
inconsistent
again
i
will
give
you
another
example
taken
from
the
state
of
modern
physical
science
since
the
time
of
newton
and
huyghens
in
the
seventeenth
century
there
have
been
two
theories
as
to
the
physical
nature
of
light
newtonâ€™s
theory
was
that
a
beam
of
light
consists
of
a
stream
of
very
minute
particles
or
corpuscles
and
that
we
have
the
sensation
of
light
when
these
corpuscles
strike
the
retinas
of
our
eyes
huyghensâ€™
theory
was
that
light
consists
of
very
minute
waves
of
trembling
in
an
all-pervading
ether
and
that
these
waves
are
travelling
along
a
beam
of
light
the
two
theories
are
contradictory
in
the
eighteenth
century
newtonâ€™s
theory
was
believed
in
the
nineteenth
century
huyghensâ€™
theory
was
believed
to-day
there
is
one
large
group
of
phenomena
which
can
be
explained
only
on
the
wave
theory
and
another
large
group
which
can
be
explained
only
on
the
corpuscular
theory
scientists
have
to
leave
it
at
that
and
wait
for
the
future
in
the
hope
of
attaining
some
wider
vision
which
reconciles
both
we
should
apply
these
same
principles
to
the
questions
in
which
there
is
a
variance
between
science
and
religion
we
would
believe
nothing
in
either
sphere
of
thought
which
does
not
appear
to
us
to
be
certified
by
solid
reasons
based
upon
the
critical
research
either
of
ourselves
or
of
competent
authorities
but
granting
that
we
have
honestly
taken
this
precaution
a
clash
between
the
two
on
points
of
detail
where
they
overlap
should
not
lead
us
hastily
to
abandon
doctrines
for
which
we
have
solid
evidence
it
may
be
that
we
are
more
interested
in
one
set
of
doctrines
than
in
the
other
but
if
we
have
any
sense
of
perspective
and
of
the
history
of
thought
we
shall
wait
and
refrain
from
mutual
anathemas
we
should
wait:
but
we
should
not
wait
passively
or
in
despair
the
clash
is
a
sign
that
there
are
wider
truths
and
finer
perspectives
within
which
a
reconciliation
of
a
deeper
religion
and
a
more
subtle
science
will
be
found
in
one
sense
therefore
the
conflict
between
science
and
religion
is
a
slight
matter
which
has
been
unduly
emphasised
a
mere
logical
contradiction
cannot
in
itself
point
to
more
than
the
necessity
of
some
readjustments
possibly
of
a
very
minor
character
on
both
sides
remember
the
widely
different
aspects
of
events
which
are
dealt
with
in
science
and
in
religion
respectively
science
is
concerned
with
the
general
conditions
which
are
observed
to
regulate
physical
phenomena
whereas
religion
is
wholly
wrapped
up
in
the
contemplation
of
moral
and
aesthetic
values
on
the
one
side
there
is
the
law
of
gravitation
and
on
the
other
the
contemplation
of
the
beauty
of
holiness
what
one
side
sees
the
other
misses
and
vice
versa
consider
for
example
the
lives
of
john
wesley
and
of
saint
francis
of
assisi
for
physical
science
you
have
in
these
lives
merely
ordinary
examples
of
the
operation
of
the
principles
of
physiological
chemistry
and
of
the
dynamics
of
nervous
reactions:
for
religion
you
have
lives
of
the
most
profound
significance
in
the
history
of
the
world
can
you
be
surprised
that
in
the
absence
of
a
perfect
and
complete
phrasing
of
the
principles
of
science
and
of
the
principles
of
religion
which
apply
to
these
specific
cases
the
accounts
of
these
lives
from
these
divergent
standpoints
should
involve
discrepancies?
it
would
be
a
miracle
if
it
were
not
so
it
would
however
be
missing
the
point
to
think
that
we
need
not
trouble
ourselves
about
the
conflict
between
science
and
religion
in
an
intellectual
age
there
can
be
no
active
interest
which
puts
aside
all
hope
of
a
vision
of
the
harmony
of
truth
to
acquiesce
in
discrepancy
is
destructive
of
candour
and
of
moral
cleanliness
it
belongs
to
the
self-respect
of
intellect
to
pursue
every
tangle
of
thought
to
its
final
unravelment
if
you
check
that
impulse
you
will
get
no
religion
and
no
science
from
an
awakened
thoughtfulness
the
important
question
is
in
what
spirit
are
we
going
to
face
the
issue?
there
we
come
to
something
absolutely
vital
a
clash
of
doctrines
is
not
a
disasterâ€”it
is
an
opportunity
i
will
explain
my
meaning
by
some
illustrations
from
science
the
weight
of
an
atom
of
nitrogen
was
well
known
also
it
was
an
established
scientific
doctrine
that
the
average
weight
of
such
atoms
in
any
considerable
mass
will
be
always
the
same
two
experimenters
the
late
lord
rayleigh
and
the
late
sir
william
ramsay
found
that
if
they
obtained
nitrogen
by
two
different
methods
each
equally
effective
for
that
purpose
they
always
observed
a
persistent
slight
difference
between
the
average
weights
of
the
atoms
in
the
two
cases
now
i
ask
you
would
it
have
been
rational
of
these
men
to
have
despaired
because
of
this
conflict
between
chemical
theory
and
scientific
observation?
suppose
that
for
some
reason
the
chemical
doctrine
had
been
highly
prized
throughout
some
district
as
the
foundation
of
its
social
order:â€”would
it
have
been
wise
would
it
have
been
candid
would
it
have
been
moral
to
forbid
the
disclosure
of
the
fact
that
the
experiments
produced
discordant
results?
or
on
the
other
hand
should
sir
william
ramsay
and
lord
rayleigh
have
proclaimed
that
chemical
theory
was
now
a
detected
delusion?
we
see
at
once
that
either
of
these
ways
would
have
been
a
method
of
facing
the
issue
in
an
entirely
wrong
spirit
what
rayleigh
and
ramsay
did
do
was
this:
they
at
once
perceived
that
they
had
hit
upon
a
line
of
investigation
which
would
disclose
some
subtlety
of
chemical
theory
that
had
hitherto
eluded
observation
the
discrepancy
was
not
a
disaster:
it
was
an
opportunity
to
increase
the
sweep
of
chemical
knowledge
you
all
know
the
end
of
the
story:
finally
argon
was
discovered
a
new
chemical
element
which
had
lurked
undetected
mixed
with
the
nitrogen
but
the
story
has
a
sequel
which
forms
my
second
illustration
this
discovery
drew
attention
to
the
importance
of
observing
accurately
minute
differences
in
chemical
substances
as
obtained
by
different
methods
further
researches
of
the
most
careful
accuracy
were
undertaken
finally
another
physicist
f
w
aston
working
in
the
cavendish
laboratory
at
cambridge
in
england
discovered
that
even
the
same
element
might
assume
two
or
more
distinct
forms
termed
isotopes
and
that
the
law
of
the
constancy
of
average
atomic
weight
holds
for
each
of
these
forms
but
as
between
the
different
isotopes
differs
slightly
the
research
has
effected
a
great
stride
in
the
power
of
chemical
theory
far
transcending
in
importance
the
discovery
of
argon
from
which
it
originated
the
moral
of
these
stories
lies
on
the
surface
and
i
will
leave
to
you
their
application
to
the
case
of
religion
and
science
in
formal
logic
a
contradiction
is
the
signal
of
a
defeat:
but
in
the
evolution
of
real
knowledge
it
marks
the
first
step
in
progress
towards
a
victory
this
is
one
great
reason
for
the
utmost
toleration
of
variety
of
opinion
once
and
forever
this
duty
of
toleration
has
been
summed
up
in
the
words
â€˜let
both
grow
together
until
the
harvest.â€™
the
failure
of
christians
to
act
up
to
this
precept
of
the
highest
authority
is
one
of
the
curiosities
of
religious
history
but
we
have
not
yet
exhausted
the
discussion
of
the
moral
temper
required
for
the
pursuit
of
truth
there
are
short
cuts
leading
merely
to
an
illusory
success
it
is
easy
enough
to
find
a
theory
logically
harmonious
and
with
important
applications
in
the
region
of
fact
provided
that
you
are
content
to
disregard
half
your
evidence
every
age
produces
people
with
clear
logical
intellects
and
with
the
most
praiseworthy
grasp
of
the
importance
of
some
sphere
of
human
experience
who
have
elaborated
or
inherited
a
scheme
of
thought
which
exactly
fits
those
experiences
which
claim
their
interest
such
people
are
apt
resolutely
to
ignore
or
to
explain
away
all
evidence
which
confuses
their
scheme
with
contradictory
instances
what
they
cannot
fit
in
is
for
them
nonsense
an
unflinching
determination
to
take
the
whole
evidence
into
account
is
the
only
method
of
preservation
against
the
fluctuating
extremes
of
fashionable
opinion
this
advice
seems
so
easy
and
is
in
fact
so
difficult
to
follow
one
reason
for
this
difficulty
is
that
we
cannot
think
first
and
act
afterwards
from
the
moment
of
birth
we
are
immersed
in
action
and
can
only
fitfully
guide
it
by
taking
thought
we
have
therefore
in
various
spheres
of
experience
to
adopt
those
ideas
which
seem
to
work
within
those
spheres
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
trust
to
ideas
which
are
generally
adequate
even
though
we
know
that
there
are
subtleties
and
distinctions
beyond
our
ken
also
apart
from
the
necessities
of
action
we
cannot
even
keep
before
our
minds
the
whole
evidence
except
under
the
guise
of
doctrines
which
are
incompletely
harmonised
we
cannot
think
in
terms
of
an
indefinite
multiplicity
of
detail
our
evidence
can
acquire
its
proper
importance
only
if
it
comes
before
us
marshalled
by
general
ideas
these
ideas
we
inheritâ€”they
form
the
tradition
of
our
civilisation
such
traditional
ideas
are
never
static
they
are
either
fading
into
meaningless
formulae
or
are
gaining
power
by
the
new
lights
thrown
by
a
more
delicate
apprehension
they
are
transformed
by
the
urge
of
critical
reason
by
the
vivid
evidence
of
emotional
experience
and
by
the
cold
certainties
of
scientific
perception
one
fact
is
certain
you
cannot
keep
them
still
no
generation
can
merely
reproduce
its
ancestors
you
may
preserve
the
life
in
a
flux
of
form
or
preserve
the
form
amid
an
ebb
of
life
but
you
cannot
permanently
enclose
the
same
life
in
the
same
mould
the
present
state
of
religion
among
the
european
races
illustrates
the
statements
which
i
have
been
making
the
phenomena
are
mixed
there
have
been
reactions
and
revivals
but
on
the
whole
during
many
generations
there
has
been
a
gradual
decay
of
religious
influence
in
european
civilisation
each
revival
touches
a
lower
peak
than
its
predecessor
and
each
period
of
slackness
a
lower
depth
the
average
curve
marks
a
steady
fall
in
religious
tone
in
some
countries
the
interest
in
religion
is
higher
than
in
others
but
in
those
countries
where
the
interest
is
relatively
high
it
still
falls
as
the
generations
pass
religion
is
tending
to
degenerate
into
a
decent
formula
wherewith
to
embellish
a
comfortable
life
a
great
historical
movement
on
this
scale
results
from
the
convergence
of
many
causes
i
wish
to
suggest
two
of
them
which
lie
within
the
scope
of
this
chapter
for
consideration
in
the
first
place
for
over
two
centuries
religion
has
been
on
the
defensive
and
on
a
weak
defensive
the
period
has
been
one
of
unprecedented
intellectual
progress
in
this
way
a
series
of
novel
situations
have
been
produced
for
thought
each
such
occasion
has
found
the
religious
thinkers
unprepared
something
which
has
been
proclaimed
to
be
vital
has
finally
after
struggle
distress
and
anathema
been
modified
and
otherwise
interpreted
the
next
generation
of
religious
apologists
then
congratulates
the
religious
world
on
the
deeper
insight
which
has
been
gained
the
result
of
the
continued
repetition
of
this
undignified
retreat
during
many
generations
has
at
last
almost
entirely
destroyed
the
intellectual
authority
of
religious
thinkers
consider
this
contrast:
when
darwin
or
einstein
proclaim
theories
which
modify
our
ideas
it
is
a
triumph
for
science
we
do
not
go
about
saying
that
there
is
another
defeat
for
science
because
its
old
ideas
have
been
abandoned
we
know
that
another
step
of
scientific
insight
has
been
gained
religion
will
not
regain
its
old
power
until
it
can
face
change
in
the
same
spirit
as
does
science
its
principles
may
be
eternal
but
the
expression
of
those
principles
requires
continual
development
this
evolution
of
religion
is
in
the
main
a
disengagement
of
its
own
proper
ideas
from
the
adventitious
notions
which
have
crept
into
it
by
reason
of
the
expression
of
its
own
ideas
in
terms
of
the
imaginative
picture
of
the
world
entertained
in
previous
ages
such
a
release
of
religion
from
the
bonds
of
imperfect
science
is
all
to
the
good
it
stresses
its
own
genuine
message
the
great
point
to
be
kept
in
mind
is
that
normally
an
advance
in
science
will
show
that
statements
of
various
religious
beliefs
require
some
sort
of
modification
it
may
be
that
they
have
to
be
expanded
or
explained
or
indeed
entirely
restated
if
the
religion
is
a
sound
expression
of
truth
this
modification
will
only
exhibit
more
adequately
the
exact
point
which
is
of
importance
this
process
is
a
gain
in
so
far
therefore
as
any
religion
has
any
contact
with
physical
facts
it
is
to
be
expected
that
the
point
of
view
of
those
facts
must
be
continually
modified
as
scientific
knowledge
advances
in
this
way
the
exact
relevance
of
these
facts
for
religious
thought
will
grow
more
and
more
clear
the
progress
of
science
must
result
in
the
unceasing
modification
of
religious
thought
to
the
great
advantage
of
religion
the
religious
controversies
of
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
put
theologians
into
a
most
unfortunate
state
of
mind
they
were
always
attacking
and
defending
they
pictured
themselves
as
the
garrison
of
a
fort
surrounded
by
hostile
forces
all
such
pictures
express
half-truths
that
is
why
they
are
so
popular
but
they
are
dangerous
this
particular
picture
fostered
a
pugnacious
party
spirit
which
really
expresses
an
ultimate
lack
of
faith
they
dared
not
modify
because
they
shirked
the
task
of
disengaging
their
spiritual
message
from
the
associations
of
a
particular
imagery
let
me
explain
myself
by
an
example
in
the
early
medieval
times
heaven
was
in
the
sky
and
hell
was
underground
volcanoes
were
the
jaws
of
hell
i
do
not
assert
that
these
beliefs
entered
into
the
official
formulations:
but
they
did
enter
into
the
popular
understanding
of
the
general
doctrines
of
heaven
and
hell
these
notions
were
what
everyone
thought
to
be
implied
by
the
doctrine
of
the
future
state
they
entered
into
the
explanations
of
the
most
influential
exponents
of
christian
belief
for
example
they
occur
in
the
dialogues
of
pope
gregory,[18
the
great
a
man
whose
high
official
position
is
surpassed
only
by
the
magnitude
of
his
services
to
humanity
i
am
not
saying
what
we
ought
to
believe
about
the
future
state
but
whatever
be
the
right
doctrine
in
this
instance
the
clash
between
religion
and
science
which
has
relegated
the
earth
to
the
position
of
a
second-rate
planet
attached
to
a
second-rate
sun
has
been
greatly
to
the
benefit
of
the
spirituality
of
religion
by
dispersing
these
medieval
fancies

another
way
of
looking
at
this
question
of
the
evolution
of
religious
thought
is
to
note
that
any
verbal
form
of
statement
which
has
been
before
the
world
for
some
time
discloses
ambiguities
and
that
often
such
ambiguities
strike
at
the
very
heart
of
the
meaning
the
effective
sense
in
which
a
doctrine
has
been
held
in
the
past
cannot
be
determined
by
the
mere
logical
analysis
of
verbal
statements
made
in
ignorance
of
the
logical
trap
you
have
to
take
into
account
the
whole
reaction
of
human
nature
to
the
scheme
of
thought
this
reaction
is
of
a
mixed
character
including
elements
of
emotion
derived
from
our
lower
natures
it
is
here
that
the
impersonal
criticism
of
science
and
of
philosophy
comes
to
the
aid
of
religious
evolution
example
after
example
can
be
given
of
this
motive
force
in
development
for
example
the
logical
difficulties
inherent
in
the
doctrine
of
the
moral
cleansing
of
human
nature
by
the
power
of
religion
rent
christianity
in
the
days
of
pelagius
and
augustineâ€”that
is
to
say
at
the
beginning
of
the
fifth
century
echoes
of
that
controversy
still
linger
in
theology
so
far
my
point
has
been
this:
that
religion
is
the
expression
of
one
type
of
fundamental
experiences
of
mankind:
that
religious
thought
develops
into
an
increasing
accuracy
of
expression
disengaged
from
adventitious
imagery:
that
the
interaction
between
religion
and
science
is
one
great
factor
in
promoting
this
development
i
now
come
to
my
second
reason
for
the
modern
fading
of
interest
in
religion
this
involves
the
ultimate
question
which
i
stated
in
my
opening
sentences
we
have
to
know
what
we
mean
by
religion
the
churches
in
their
presentation
of
their
answers
to
this
query
have
put
forward
aspects
of
religion
which
are
expressed
in
terms
either
suited
to
the
emotional
reactions
of
bygone
times
or
directed
to
excite
modern
emotional
interests
of
a
nonreligious
character
what
i
mean
under
the
first
heading
is
that
religious
appeal
is
directed
partly
to
excite
that
instinctive
fear
of
the
wrath
of
a
tyrant
which
was
inbred
in
the
unhappy
populations
of
the
arbitrary
empires
of
the
ancient
world
and
in
particular
to
excite
that
fear
of
an
all-powerful
arbitrary
tyrant
behind
the
unknown
forces
of
nature
this
appeal
to
the
ready
instinct
of
brute
fear
is
losing
its
force
it
lacks
any
directness
of
response
because
modern
science
and
modern
conditions
of
life
have
taught
us
to
meet
occasions
of
apprehension
by
a
critical
analysis
of
their
causes
and
conditions
religion
is
the
reaction
of
human
nature
to
its
search
for
god
the
presentation
of
god
under
the
aspect
of
power
awakens
every
modern
instinct
of
critical
reaction
this
is
fatal
for
religion
collapses
unless
its
main
positions
command
immediacy
of
assent
in
this
respect
the
old
phraseology
is
at
variance
with
the
psychology
of
modern
civilisations
this
change
in
psychology
is
largely
due
to
science
and
is
one
of
the
chief
ways
in
which
the
advance
of
science
has
weakened
the
hold
of
the
old
religious
forms
of
expression
the
nonreligious
motive
which
has
entered
into
modern
religious
thought
is
the
desire
for
a
comfortable
organisation
of
modern
society
religion
has
been
presented
as
valuable
for
the
ordering
of
life
its
claims
have
been
rested
upon
its
function
as
a
sanction
to
right
conduct
also
the
purpose
of
right
conduct
quickly
degenerates
into
the
formation
of
pleasing
social
relations
we
have
here
a
subtle
degradation
of
religious
ideas
following
upon
their
gradual
purification
under
the
influence
of
keener
ethical
intuitions
conduct
is
a
by-product
of
religionâ€”an
inevitable
by-product
but
not
the
main
point
every
great
religious
teacher
has
revolted
against
the
presentation
of
religion
as
a
mere
sanction
of
rules
of
conduct
saint
paul
denounced
the
law
and
puritan
divines
spoke
of
the
filthy
rags
of
righteousness
the
insistence
upon
rules
of
conduct
marks
the
ebb
of
religious
fervour
above
and
beyond
all
things
the
religious
life
is
not
a
research
after
comfort
i
must
now
state
in
all
diffidence
what
i
conceive
to
be
the
essential
character
of
the
religious
spirit
religion
is
the
vision
of
something
which
stands
beyond
behind
and
within
the
passing
flux
of
immediate
things
something
which
is
real
and
yet
waiting
to
be
realised
something
which
is
a
remote
possibility
and
yet
the
greatest
of
present
facts
something
that
gives
meaning
to
all
that
passes
and
yet
eludes
apprehension
something
whose
possession
is
the
final
good
and
yet
is
beyond
all
reach
something
which
is
the
ultimate
ideal
and
the
hopeless
quest
the
immediate
reaction
of
human
nature
to
the
religious
vision
is
worship
religion
has
emerged
into
human
experience
mixed
with
the
crudest
fancies
of
barbaric
imagination
gradually
slowly
steadily
the
vision
recurs
in
history
under
nobler
form
and
with
clearer
expression
it
is
the
one
element
in
human
experience
which
persistently
shows
an
upward
trend
it
fades
and
then
recurs
but
when
it
renews
its
force
it
recurs
with
an
added
richness
and
purity
of
content
the
fact
of
the
religious
vision
and
its
history
of
persistent
expansion
is
our
one
ground
for
optimism
apart
from
it
human
life
is
a
flash
of
occasional
enjoyments
lighting
up
a
mass
of
pain
and
misery
a
bagatelle
of
transient
experience
the
vision
claims
nothing
but
worship
and
worship
is
a
surrender
to
the
claim
for
assimilation
urged
with
the
motive
force
of
mutual
love
the
vision
never
overrules
it
is
always
there
and
it
has
the
power
of
love
presenting
the
one
purpose
whose
fulfilment
is
eternal
harmony
such
order
as
we
find
in
nature
is
never
forceâ€”it
presents
itself
as
the
one
harmonious
adjustment
of
complex
detail
evil
is
the
brute
motive
force
of
fragmentary
purpose
disregarding
the
eternal
vision
evil
is
overruling
retarding
hurting
the
power
of
god
is
the
worship
he
inspires
that
religion
is
strong
which
in
its
ritual
and
its
modes
of
thought
evokes
an
apprehension
of
the
commanding
vision
the
worship
of
god
is
not
a
rule
of
safetyâ€”it
is
an
adventure
of
the
spirit
a
flight
after
the
unattainable
the
death
of
religion
comes
with
the
repression
of
the
high
hope
of
adventure

requisites
for
social
progress
it
has
been
the
purpose
of
these
lectures
to
analyse
the
reactions
of
science
in
forming
that
background
of
instinctive
ideas
which
control
the
activities
of
successive
generations
such
a
background
takes
the
form
of
a
certain
vague
philosophy
as
to
the
last
word
about
things
when
all
is
said
the
three
centuries
which
form
the
epoch
of
modern
science
have
revolved
round
the
ideas
of
god
mind
matter
and
also
of
space
and
time
in
their
characters
of
expressing
simple
location
for
matter
philosophy
has
on
the
whole
emphasised
mind
and
has
thus
been
out
of
touch
with
science
during
the
two
latter
centuries
but
it
is
creeping
back
into
its
old
importance
owing
to
the
rise
of
psychology
and
its
alliance
with
physiology
also
this
rehabilitation
of
philosophy
has
been
facilitated
by
the
recent
breakdown
of
the
seventeenth
century
settlement
of
the
principles
of
physical
science
but
until
that
collapse
science
seated
itself
securely
upon
the
concepts
of
matter
space
time
and
latterly
of
energy
also
there
were
arbitrary
laws
of
nature
determining
locomotion
they
were
empirically
observed
but
for
some
obscure
reason
were
known
to
be
universal
anyone
who
in
practice
or
theory
disregarded
them
was
denounced
with
unsparing
vigour
this
position
on
the
part
of
scientists
was
pure
bluff
if
one
may
credit
them
with
believing
their
own
statements
for
their
current
philosophy
completely
failed
to
justify
the
assumption
that
the
immediate
knowledge
inherent
in
any
present
occasion
throws
any
light
either
on
its
past
or
its
future
i
have
also
sketched
an
alternative
philosophy
of
science
in
which
organism
takes
the
place
of
matter
for
this
purpose
the
mind
involved
in
the
materialist
theory
dissolves
into
a
function
of
organism
the
psychological
field
then
exhibits
what
an
event
is
in
itself
our
bodily
event
is
an
unusually
complex
type
of
organism
and
consequently
includes
cognition
further
space
and
time
in
their
most
concrete
signification
become
the
locus
of
events
an
organism
is
the
realisation
of
a
definite
shape
of
value
the
emergence
of
some
actual
value
depends
on
limitation
which
excludes
neutralising
cross-lights
thus
an
event
is
a
matter
of
fact
which
by
reason
of
its
limitation
is
a
value
for
itself
but
by
reason
of
its
very
nature
it
also
requires
the
whole
universe
in
order
to
be
itself
importance
depends
on
endurance
endurance
is
the
retention
through
time
of
an
achievement
of
value
what
endures
is
identity
of
pattern
self-inherited
endurance
requires
the
favourable
environment
the
whole
of
science
revolves
round
this
question
of
enduring
organisms
the
general
influence
of
science
at
the
present
moment
can
be
analysed
under
the
headings:
general
conceptions
respecting
the
universe
technological
applications
professionalism
in
knowledge
influence
of
biological
doctrines
on
the
motives
of
conduct
i
have
endeavoured
in
the
preceding
lectures
to
give
a
glimpse
of
these
points
it
lies
within
the
scope
of
this
concluding
lecture
to
consider
the
reaction
of
science
upon
some
problems
confronting
civilised
societies
the
general
conceptions
introduced
by
science
into
modern
thought
cannot
be
separated
from
the
philosophical
situation
as
expressed
by
descartes
i
mean
the
assumption
of
bodies
and
minds
as
independent
individual
substances
each
existing
in
its
own
right
apart
from
any
necessary
reference
to
each
other
such
a
conception
was
very
concordant
with
the
individualism
which
had
issued
from
the
moral
discipline
of
the
middle
ages
but
though
the
easy
reception
of
the
idea
is
thus
explained
the
derivation
in
itself
rests
upon
a
confusion
very
natural
but
none
the
less
unfortunate
the
moral
discipline
had
emphasized
the
intrinsic
value
of
the
individual
entity
this
emphasis
had
put
the
notions
of
the
individual
and
of
its
experiences
into
the
foreground
of
thought
at
this
point
the
confusion
commences
the
emergent
individual
value
of
each
entity
is
transformed
into
the
independent
substantial
existence
of
each
entity
which
is
a
very
different
notion
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
descartes
made
this
logical
or
rather
illogical
transition
in
the
form
of
explicit
reasoning
far
from
it
what
he
did
was
first
to
concentrate
upon
his
own
conscious
experiences
as
being
facts
within
the
independent
world
of
his
own
mentality
he
was
led
to
speculate
in
this
way
by
the
current
emphasis
upon
the
individual
value
of
his
total
self
he
implicitly
transformed
this
emergent
individual
value
inherent
in
the
very
fact
of
his
own
reality
into
a
private
world
of
passions
or
modes
of
independent
substance
also
the
independence
ascribed
to
bodily
substances
carried
them
away
from
the
realm
of
values
altogether
they
degenerated
into
a
mechanism
entirely
valueless
except
as
suggestive
of
an
external
ingenuity
the
heavens
had
lost
the
glory
of
god
this
state
of
mind
is
illustrated
in
the
recoil
of
protestantism
from
aesthetic
effects
dependent
upon
a
material
medium
it
was
taken
to
lead
to
an
ascription
of
value
to
what
is
in
itself
valueless
this
recoil
was
already
in
full
strength
antecedently
to
descartes
accordingly
the
cartesian
scientific
doctrine
of
bits
of
matter
bare
of
intrinsic
value
was
merely
a
formulation
in
explicit
terms
of
a
doctrine
which
was
current
before
its
entrance
into
scientific
thought
or
cartesian
philosophy
probably
this
doctrine
was
latent
in
the
scholastic
philosophy
but
it
did
not
lead
to
its
consequences
till
it
met
with
the
mentality
of
northern
europe
in
the
sixteenth
century
but
science
as
equipped
by
descartes
gave
stability
and
intellectual
status
to
a
point
of
view
which
has
had
very
mixed
effects
upon
the
moral
presuppositions
of
modern
communities
its
good
effects
arose
from
its
efficiency
as
a
method
for
scientific
researches
within
those
limited
regions
which
were
then
best
suited
for
exploration
the
result
was
a
general
clearing
of
the
european
mind
away
from
the
stains
left
upon
it
by
the
hysteria
of
remote
barbaric
ages
this
was
all
to
the
good
and
was
most
completely
exemplified
in
the
eighteenth
century
but
in
the
nineteenth
century
when
society
was
undergoing
transformation
into
the
manufacturing
system
the
bad
effects
of
these
doctrines
have
been
very
fatal
the
doctrine
of
minds
as
independent
substances
leads
directly
not
merely
to
private
worlds
of
experience
but
also
to
private
worlds
of
morals
the
moral
intuitions
can
be
held
to
apply
only
to
the
strictly
private
world
of
psychological
experience
accordingly
self-respect
and
the
making
the
most
of
your
own
individual
opportunities
together
constituted
the
efficient
morality
of
the
leaders
among
the
industrialists
of
that
period
the
western
world
is
now
suffering
from
the
limited
moral
outlook
of
the
three
previous
generations
also
the
assumption
of
the
bare
valuelessness
of
mere
matter
led
to
a
lack
of
reverence
in
the
treatment
of
natural
or
artistic
beauty
just
when
the
urbanisation
of
the
western
world
was
entering
upon
its
state
of
rapid
development
and
when
the
most
delicate
anxious
consideration
of
the
aesthetic
qualities
of
the
new
material
environment
was
requisite
the
doctrine
of
the
irrelevance
of
such
ideas
was
at
its
height
in
the
most
advanced
industrial
countries
art
was
treated
as
a
frivolity
a
striking
example
of
this
state
of
mind
in
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
is
to
be
seen
in
london
where
the
marvellous
beauty
of
the
estuary
of
the
thames
as
it
curves
through
the
city
is
wantonly
defaced
by
the
charing
cross
railway
bridge
constructed
apart
from
any
reference
to
aesthetic
values
the
two
evils
are:
one
the
ignoration
of
the
true
relation
of
each
organism
to
its
environment
and
the
other
the
habit
of
ignoring
the
intrinsic
worth
of
the
environment
which
must
be
allowed
its
weight
in
any
consideration
of
final
ends
another
great
fact
confronting
the
modern
world
is
the
discovery
of
the
method
of
training
professionals
who
specialise
in
particular
regions
of
thought
and
thereby
progressively
add
to
the
sum
of
knowledge
within
their
respective
limitations
of
subject
in
consequence
of
the
success
of
this
professionalising
of
knowledge
there
are
two
points
to
be
kept
in
mind
which
differentiate
our
present
age
from
the
past
in
the
first
place
the
rate
of
progress
is
such
that
an
individual
human
being
of
ordinary
length
of
life
will
be
called
upon
to
face
novel
situations
which
find
no
parallel
in
his
past
the
fixed
person
for
the
fixed
duties
who
in
older
societies
was
such
a
godsend
in
the
future
will
be
a
public
danger
in
the
second
place
the
modern
professionalism
in
knowledge
works
in
the
opposite
direction
so
far
as
the
intellectual
sphere
is
concerned
the
modern
chemist
is
likely
to
be
weak
in
zoology
weaker
still
in
his
general
knowledge
of
the
elizabethan
drama
and
completely
ignorant
of
the
principles
of
rhythm
in
english
versification
it
is
probably
safe
to
ignore

i
am
speaking
of
general
tendencies
for
chemists
are
no
worse
than
engineers
or
mathematicians
or
classical
scholars
effective
knowledge
is
professionalised
knowledge
supported
by
a
restricted
acquaintance
with
useful
subjects
subservient
to
it
this
situation
has
its
dangers
it
produces
minds
in
a
groove
each
profession
makes
progress
but
it
is
progress
in
its
own
groove
now
to
be
mentally
in
a
groove
is
to
live
in
contemplating
a
given
set
of
abstractions
the
groove
prevents
straying
across
country
and
the
abstraction
abstracts
from
something
to
which
no
further
attention
is
paid
but
there
is
no
groove
of
abstractions
which
is
adequate
for
the
comprehension
of
human
life
thus
in
the
modern
world
the
celibacy
of
the
medieval
learned
class
has
been
replaced
by
a
celibacy
of
the
intellect
which
is
divorced
from
the
concrete
contemplation
of
the
complete
facts
of
course
no
one
is
merely
a
mathematician
or
merely
a
lawyer
people
have
lives
outside
their
professions
or
their
businesses
but
the
point
is
the
restraint
of
serious
thought
within
a
groove
the
remainder
of
life
is
treated
superficially
with
the
imperfect
categories
of
thought
derived
from
one
profession
the
dangers
arising
from
this
aspect
of
professionalism
are
great
particularly
in
our
democratic
societies
the
directive
force
of
reason
is
weakened
the
leading
intellects
lack
balance
they
see
this
set
of
circumstances
or
that
set
but
not
both
sets
together
the
task
of
coã¶rdination
is
left
to
those
who
lack
either
the
force
or
the
character
to
succeed
in
some
definite
career
in
short
the
specialised
functions
of
the
community
are
performed
better
and
more
progressively
but
the
generalised
direction
lacks
vision
the
progressiveness
in
detail
only
adds
to
the
danger
produced
by
the
feebleness
of
coã¶rdination
this
criticism
of
modern
life
applies
throughout
in
whatever
sense
you
construe
the
meaning
of
a
community
it
holds
if
you
apply
it
to
a
nation
a
city
a
district
an
institution
a
family
or
even
to
an
individual
there
is
a
development
of
particular
abstractions
and
a
contraction
of
concrete
appreciation
the
whole
is
lost
in
one
of
its
aspects
it
is
not
necessary
for
my
point
that
i
should
maintain
that
our
directive
wisdom
either
as
individuals
or
as
communities
is
less
now
than
in
the
past
perhaps
it
has
slightly
improved
but
the
novel
pace
of
progress
requires
a
greater
force
of
direction
if
disasters
are
to
be
avoided
the
point
is
that
the
discoveries
of
the
nineteenth
century
were
in
the
direction
of
professionalism
so
that
we
are
left
with
no
expansion
of
wisdom
and
with
greater
need
of
it
wisdom
is
the
fruit
of
a
balanced
development
it
is
this
balanced
growth
of
individuality
which
it
should
be
the
aim
of
education
to
secure
the
most
useful
discoveries
for
the
immediate
future
would
concern
the
furtherance
of
this
aim
without
detriment
to
the
necessary
intellectual
professionalism
my
own
criticism
of
our
traditional
educational
methods
is
that
they
are
far
too
much
occupied
with
intellectual
analysis
and
with
the
acquirement
of
formularised
information
what
i
mean
is
that
we
neglect
to
strengthen
habits
of
concrete
appreciation
of
the
individual
facts
in
their
full
interplay
of
emergent
values
and
that
we
merely
emphasise
abstract
formulations
which
ignore
this
aspect
of
the
interplay
of
diverse
values
in
every
country
the
problem
of
the
balance
of
the
general
and
specialist
education
is
under
consideration
i
cannot
speak
with
first-hand
knowledge
of
any
country
but
my
own
i
know
that
there
among
practical
educationalists
there
is
considerable
dissatisfaction
with
the
existing
practice
also
the
adaptation
of
the
whole
system
to
the
needs
of
a
democratic
community
is
very
far
from
being
solved
i
do
not
think
that
the
secret
of
the
solution
lies
in
terms
of
the
antithesis
between
thoroughness
in
special
knowledge
and
general
knowledge
of
a
slighter
character
the
make-weight
which
balances
the
thoroughness
of
the
specialist
intellectual
training
should
be
of
a
radically
different
kind
from
purely
intellectual
analytical
knowledge
at
present
our
education
combines
a
thorough
study
of
a
few
abstractions
with
a
slighter
study
of
a
larger
number
of
abstractions
we
are
too
exclusively
bookish
in
our
scholastic
routine
the
general
training
should
aim
at
eliciting
our
concrete
apprehensions
and
should
satisfy
the
itch
of
youth
to
be
doing
something
there
should
be
some
analysis
even
here
but
only
just
enough
to
illustrate
the
ways
of
thinking
in
diverse
spheres
in
the
garden
of
eden
adam
saw
the
animals
before
he
named
them:
in
the
traditional
system
children
named
the
animals
before
they
saw
them
there
is
no
easy
single
solution
of
the
practical
difficulties
of
education
we
can
however
guide
ourselves
by
a
certain
simplicity
in
its
general
theory
the
student
should
concentrate
within
a
limited
field
such
concentration
should
include
all
practical
and
intellectual
acquirements
requisite
for
that
concentration
this
is
the
ordinary
procedure
and
in
respect
to
it
i
should
be
inclined
even
to
increase
the
facilities
for
concentration
rather
than
to
diminish
them
with
the
concentration
there
are
associated
certain
subsidiary
studies
such
as
languages
for
science
such
a
scheme
of
professional
training
should
be
directed
to
a
clear
end
congenial
to
the
student
it
is
not
necessary
to
elaborate
the
qualifications
of
these
statements
such
a
training
must
of
course
have
the
width
requisite
for
its
end
but
its
design
should
not
be
complicated
by
the
consideration
of
other
ends
this
professional
training
can
only
touch
one
side
of
education
its
centre
of
gravity
lies
in
the
intellect
and
its
chief
tool
is
the
printed
book
the
centre
of
gravity
of
the
other
side
of
training
should
lie
in
intuition
without
an
analytical
divorce
from
the
total
environment
its
object
is
immediate
apprehension
with
the
minimum
of
eviscerating
analysis
the
type
of
generality
which
above
all
is
wanted
is
the
appreciation
of
variety
of
value
i
mean
an
aesthetic
growth
there
is
something
between
the
gross
specialised
values
of
the
mere
practical
man
and
the
thin
specialised
values
of
the
mere
scholar
both
types
have
missed
something
and
if
you
add
together
the
two
sets
of
values
you
do
not
obtain
the
missing
elements
what
is
wanted
is
an
appreciation
of
the
infinite
variety
of
vivid
values
achieved
by
an
organism
in
its
proper
environment
when
you
understand
all
about
the
sun
and
all
about
the
atmosphere
and
all
about
the
rotation
of
the
earth
you
may
still
miss
the
radiance
of
the
sunset
there
is
no
substitute
for
the
direct
perception
of
the
concrete
achievement
of
a
thing
in
its
actuality
we
want
concrete
fact
with
a
high
light
thrown
on
what
is
relevant
to
its
preciousness
what
i
mean
is
art
and
aesthetic
education
it
is
however
art
in
such
a
general
sense
of
the
term
that
i
hardly
like
to
call
it
by
that
name
art
is
a
special
example
what
we
want
is
to
draw
out
habits
of
aesthetic
apprehension
according
to
the
metaphysical
doctrine
which
i
have
been
developing
to
do
so
is
to
increase
the
depth
of
individuality
the
analysis
of
reality
indicates
the
two
factors
activity
emerging
into
individualised
aesthetic
value
also
the
emergent
value
is
the
measure
of
the
individualisation
of
the
activity
we
must
foster
the
creative
initiative
towards
the
maintenance
of
objective
values
you
will
not
obtain
the
apprehension
without
the
initiative
or
the
initiative
without
the
apprehension
as
soon
as
you
get
towards
the
concrete
you
cannot
exclude
action
sensitiveness
without
impulse
spells
decadence
and
impulse
without
sensitiveness
spells
brutality
i
am
using
the
word
â€œsensitivenessâ€
in
its
most
general
signification
so
as
to
include
apprehension
of
what
lies
beyond
oneself
that
is
to
say
sensitiveness
to
all
the
facts
of
the
case
thus
â€œartâ€
in
the
general
sense
which
i
require
is
any
selection
by
which
the
concrete
facts
are
so
arranged
as
to
elicit
attention
to
particular
values
which
are
realisable
by
them
for
example
the
mere
disposing
of
the
human
body
and
the
eyesight
so
as
to
get
a
good
view
of
a
sunset
is
a
simple
form
of
artistic
selection
the
habit
of
art
is
the
habit
of
enjoying
vivid
values
but
in
this
sense
art
concerns
more
than
sunsets
a
factory
with
its
machinery
its
community
of
operatives
its
social
service
to
the
general
population
its
dependence
upon
organising
and
designing
genius
its
potentialities
as
a
source
of
wealth
to
the
holders
of
its
stock
is
an
organism
exhibiting
a
variety
of
vivid
values
what
we
want
to
train
is
the
habit
of
apprehending
such
an
organism
in
its
completeness
it
is
very
arguable
that
the
science
of
political
economy
as
studied
in
its
first
period
after
the
death
of
adam
smith
1790
did
more
harm
than
good
it
destroyed
many
economic
fallacies
and
taught
how
to
think
about
the
economic
revolution
then
in
progress
but
it
riveted
on
men
a
certain
set
of
abstractions
which
were
disastrous
in
their
influence
on
modern
mentality
it
de-humanised
industry
this
is
only
one
example
of
a
general
danger
inherent
in
modern
science
its
methodological
procedure
is
exclusive
and
intolerant
and
rightly
so
it
fixes
attention
on
a
definite
group
of
abstractions
neglects
everything
else
and
elicits
every
scrap
of
information
and
theory
which
is
relevant
to
what
it
has
retained
this
method
is
triumphant
provided
that
the
abstractions
are
judicious
but
however
triumphant
the
triumph
is
within
limits
the
neglect
of
these
limits
leads
to
disastrous
oversights
the
anti-rationalism
of
science
is
partly
justified
as
a
preservation
of
its
useful
methodology
it
is
partly
mere
irrational
prejudice
modern
professionalism
is
the
training
of
minds
to
conform
to
the
methodology
the
historical
revolt
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
the
earlier
reaction
towards
naturalism
were
examples
of
transcending
the
abstractions
which
fascinated
educated
society
in
the
middle
ages
these
early
ages
had
an
ideal
of
rationalism
but
they
failed
in
its
pursuit
for
they
neglected
to
note
that
the
methodology
of
reasoning
requires
the
limitations
involved
in
the
abstract
accordingly
the
true
rationalism
must
always
transcend
itself
by
recurrence
to
the
concrete
in
search
of
inspiration
a
self-satisfied
rationalism
is
in
effect
a
form
of
anti-rationalism
it
means
an
arbitrary
halt
at
a
particular
set
of
abstractions
this
was
the
case
with
science
there
are
two
principles
inherent
in
the
very
nature
of
things
recurring
in
some
particular
embodiments
whatever
field
we
exploreâ€”the
spirit
of
change
and
the
spirit
of
conservation
there
can
be
nothing
real
without
both
mere
change
without
conservation
is
a
passage
from
nothing
to
nothing
its
final
integration
yields
mere
transient
non-entity
mere
conservation
without
change
cannot
conserve
for
after
all
there
is
a
flux
of
circumstance
and
the
freshness
of
being
evaporates
under
mere
repetition
the
character
of
existent
reality
is
composed
of
organisms
enduring
through
the
flux
of
things
the
low
type
of
organisms
have
achieved
a
self-identity
dominating
their
whole
physical
life
electrons
molecules
crystals
belong
to
this
type
they
exhibit
a
massive
and
complete
sameness
in
the
higher
types
where
life
appears
there
is
greater
complexity
thus
though
there
is
a
complex
enduring
pattern
it
has
retreated
into
deeper
recesses
of
the
total
fact
in
a
sense
the
self-identity
of
a
human
being
is
more
abstract
than
that
of
a
crystal
it
is
the
life
of
the
spirit
it
relates
rather
to
the
individualisation
of
the
creative
activity
so
that
the
changing
circumstances
received
from
the
environment
are
differentiated
from
the
living
personality
and
are
thought
of
as
forming
its
perceived
field
in
truth
the
field
of
perception
and
the
perceiving
mind
are
abstractions
which
in
the
concrete
combine
into
the
successive
bodily
events
the
psychological
field
as
restricted
to
sense-objects
and
passing
emotions
is
the
minor
permanence
barely
rescued
from
the
nonentity
of
mere
change
and
the
mind
is
the
major
permanence
permeating
that
complete
field
whose
endurance
is
the
living
soul
but
the
soul
would
wither
without
fertilisation
from
its
transient
experiences
the
secret
of
the
higher
organisms
lies
in
their
two
grades
of
permanences
by
this
means
the
freshness
of
the
environment
is
absorbed
into
the
permanence
of
the
soul
the
changing
environment
is
no
longer
by
reason
of
its
variety
an
enemy
to
the
endurance
of
the
organism
the
pattern
of
the
higher
organism
has
retreated
into
the
recesses
of
the
individualised
activity
it
has
become
a
uniform
way
of
dealing
with
circumstances
and
this
way
is
only
strengthened
by
having
a
proper
variety
of
circumstances
to
deal
with
this
fertilisation
of
the
soul
is
the
reason
for
the
necessity
of
art
a
static
value
however
serious
and
important
becomes
unendurable
by
its
appalling
monotony
of
endurance
the
soul
cries
aloud
for
release
into
change
it
suffers
the
agonies
of
claustrophobia
the
transitions
of
humour
wit
irreverence
play
sleep
andâ€”above
allâ€”of
art
are
necessary
for
it
great
art
is
the
arrangement
of
the
environment
so
as
to
provide
for
the
soul
vivid
but
transient
values
human
beings
require
something
which
absorbs
them
for
a
time
something
out
of
the
routine
which
they
can
stare
at
but
you
cannot
subdivide
life
except
in
the
abstract
analysis
of
thought
accordingly
the
great
art
is
more
than
a
transient
refreshment
it
is
something
which
adds
to
the
permanent
richness
of
the
soulâ€™s
self-attainment
it
justifies
itself
both
by
its
immediate
enjoyment
and
also
by
its
discipline
of
the
inmost
being
its
discipline
is
not
distinct
from
enjoyment
but
by
reason
of
it
it
transforms
the
soul
into
the
permanent
realisation
of
values
extending
beyond
its
former
self
this
element
of
transition
in
art
is
shown
by
the
restlessness
exhibited
in
its
history
an
epoch
gets
saturated
by
the
masterpieces
of
any
one
style
something
new
must
be
discovered
the
human
being
wanders
on
yet
there
is
a
balance
in
things
mere
change
before
the
attainment
of
adequacy
of
achievement
either
in
quality
or
output
is
destructive
of
greatness
but
the
importance
of
a
living
art
which
moves
on
and
yet
leaves
its
permanent
mark
can
hardly
be
exaggerated
in
regard
to
the
aesthetic
needs
of
civilised
society
the
reactions
of
science
have
so
far
been
unfortunate
its
materialistic
basis
has
directed
attention
to
things
as
opposed
to
values
the
antithesis
is
a
false
one
if
taken
in
a
concrete
sense
but
it
is
valid
at
the
abstract
level
of
ordinary
thought
this
misplaced
emphasis
coalesced
with
the
abstractions
of
political
economy
which
are
in
fact
the
abstractions
in
terms
of
which
commercial
affairs
are
carried
on
thus
all
thought
concerned
with
social
organisation
expressed
itself
in
terms
of
material
things
and
of
capital
ultimate
values
were
excluded
they
were
politely
bowed
to
and
then
handed
over
to
the
clergy
to
be
kept
for
sundays
a
creed
of
competitive
business
morality
was
evolved
in
some
respects
curiously
high
but
entirely
devoid
of
consideration
for
the
value
of
human
life
the
workmen
were
conceived
as
mere
hands
drawn
from
the
pool
of
labour
to
godâ€™s
question
men
gave
the
answer
of
cainâ€”â€œam
i
my
brotherâ€™s
keeper?â€
and
they
incurred
cainâ€™s
guilt
this
was
the
atmosphere
in
which
the
industrial
revolution
was
accomplished
in
england
and
to
a
large
extent
elsewhere
the
internal
history
of
england
during
the
last
half
century
has
been
an
endeavour
slowly
and
painfully
to
undo
the
evils
wrought
in
the
first
stage
of
the
new
epoch
it
may
be
that
civilisation
will
never
recover
from
the
bad
climate
which
enveloped
the
introduction
of
machinery
this
climate
pervaded
the
whole
commercial
system
of
the
progressive
northern
european
races
it
was
partly
the
result
of
the
aesthetic
errors
of
protestantism
and
partly
the
result
of
scientific
materialism
and
partly
the
result
of
the
natural
greed
of
mankind
and
partly
the
result
of
the
abstractions
of
political
economy
an
illustration
of
my
point
is
to
be
found
in
macaulayâ€™s
essay
criticising
southeyâ€™s
colloquies
on
society
it
was
written
in
1830
now
macaulay
was
a
very
favourable
example
of
men
living
at
that
date
or
at
any
date
he
had
genius
he
was
kind-hearted
honourable
and
a
reformer
this
is
the
extract:â€”â€œwe
are
told
that
our
age
has
invented
atrocities
beyond
the
imagination
of
our
fathers
that
society
has
been
brought
into
a
state
compared
with
which
extermination
would
be
a
blessing
and
all
because
the
dwellings
of
cotton-spinners
are
naked
and
rectangular
mr
southey
has
found
out
a
way
he
tells
us
in
which
the
effects
of
manufactures
and
agriculture
may
be
compared
and
what
is
this
way?
to
stand
on
a
hill
to
look
at
a
cottage
and
a
factory
and
to
see
which
is
the
prettier.â€
southey
seems
to
have
said
many
silly
things
in
his
book
but
so
far
as
this
extract
is
concerned
he
could
make
a
good
case
for
himself
if
he
returned
to
earth
after
the
lapse
of
nearly
a
century
the
evils
of
the
early
industrial
system
are
now
a
commonplace
of
knowledge
the
point
which
i
am
insisting
on
is
the
stone-blind
eye
with
which
even
the
best
men
of
that
time
regarded
the
importance
of
aesthetics
in
a
nationâ€™s
life
i
do
not
believe
that
we
have
as
yet
nearly
achieved
the
right
estimate
a
contributory
cause
of
substantial
efficacy
to
produce
this
disastrous
error
was
the
scientific
creed
that
matter
in
motion
is
the
one
concrete
reality
in
nature
so
that
aesthetic
values
form
an
adventitious
irrelevant
addition
there
is
another
side
to
this
picture
of
the
possibilities
of
decadence
at
the
present
moment
a
discussion
is
raging
as
to
the
future
of
civilisation
in
the
novel
circumstances
of
rapid
scientific
and
technological
advance
the
evils
of
the
future
have
been
diagnosed
in
various
ways
the
loss
of
religious
faith
the
malignant
use
of
material
power
the
degradation
attending
a
differential
birth
rate
favouring
the
lower
types
of
humanity
the
suppression
of
aesthetic
creativeness
without
doubt
these
are
all
evils
dangerous
and
threatening
but
they
are
not
new
from
the
dawn
of
history
mankind
has
always
been
losing
its
religious
faith
has
always
suffered
from
the
malignant
use
of
material
power
has
always
suffered
from
the
infertility
of
its
best
intellectual
types
has
always
witnessed
the
periodical
decadence
of
art
in
the
reign
of
the
egyptian
king
tutankhamen
there
was
raging
a
desperate
religious
struggle
between
modernists
and
fundamentalists
the
cave
pictures
exhibit
a
phase
of
delicate
aesthetic
achievement
as
superseded
by
a
period
of
comparative
vulgarity
the
religious
leaders
the
great
thinkers
the
great
poets
and
authors
the
whole
clerical
caste
in
the
middle
ages
have
been
notably
infertile
finally
if
we
attend
to
what
actually
has
happened
in
the
past
and
disregard
romantic
visions
of
democracies
aristocracies
kings
generals
armies
and
merchants
material
power
has
generally
been
wielded
with
blindness
obstinacy
and
selfishness
often
with
brutal
malignancy
and
yet
mankind
has
progressed
even
if
you
take
a
tiny
oasis
of
peculiar
excellence
the
type
of
modern
man
who
would
have
most
chance
of
happiness
in
ancient
greece
at
its
best
period
is
probably
as
now
an
average
professional
heavy-weight
boxer
and
not
an
average
greek
scholar
from
oxford
or
germany
indeed
the
main
use
of
the
oxford
scholar
would
have
been
his
capability
of
writing
an
ode
in
glorification
of
the
boxer
nothing
does
more
harm
in
unnerving
men
for
their
duties
in
the
present
than
the
attention
devoted
to
the
points
of
excellence
in
the
past
as
compared
with
the
average
failure
of
the
present
day
but
after
all
there
have
been
real
periods
of
decadence
and
at
the
present
time
as
at
other
epochs
society
is
decaying
and
there
is
need
for
preservative
action
professionals
are
not
new
to
the
world
but
in
the
past
professionals
have
formed
unprogressive
castes
the
point
is
that
professionalism
has
now
been
mated
with
progress
the
world
is
now
faced
with
a
self-evolving
system
which
it
cannot
stop
there
are
dangers
and
advantages
in
this
situation
it
is
obvious
that
the
gain
in
material
power
affords
opportunity
for
social
betterment
if
mankind
can
rise
to
the
occasion
there
lies
in
front
a
golden
age
of
beneficent
creativeness
but
material
power
in
itself
is
ethically
neutral
it
can
equally
well
work
in
the
wrong
direction
the
problem
is
not
how
to
produce
great
men
but
how
to
produce
great
societies
the
great
society
will
put
up
the
men
for
the
occasions
the
materialistic
philosophy
emphasised
the
given
quantity
of
material
and
thence
derivatively
the
given
nature
of
the
environment
it
thus
operated
most
unfortunately
upon
the
social
conscience
of
mankind
for
it
directed
almost
exclusive
attention
to
the
aspect
of
struggle
for
existence
in
a
fixed
environment
to
a
large
extent
the
environment
is
fixed
and
to
this
extent
there
is
a
struggle
for
existence
it
is
folly
to
look
at
the
universe
through
rose-tinted
spectacles
we
must
admit
the
struggle
the
question
is
who
is
to
be
eliminated
in
so
far
as
we
are
educators
we
have
to
have
clear
ideas
upon
that
point
for
it
settles
the
type
to
be
produced
and
the
practical
ethics
to
be
inculcated
but
during
the
last
three
generations
the
exclusive
direction
of
attention
to
this
aspect
of
things
has
been
a
disaster
of
the
first
magnitude
the
watchwords
of
the
nineteenth
century
have
been
struggle
for
existence
competition
class
warfare
commercial
antagonism
between
nations
military
warfare
the
struggle
for
existence
has
been
construed
into
the
gospel
of
hate
the
full
conclusion
to
be
drawn
from
a
philosophy
of
evolution
is
fortunately
of
a
more
balanced
character
successful
organisms
modify
their
environment
those
organisms
are
successful
which
modify
their
environments
so
as
to
assist
each
other
this
law
is
exemplified
in
nature
on
a
vast
scale
for
example
the
north
american
indians
accepted
their
environment
with
the
result
that
a
scanty
population
barely
succeeded
in
maintaining
themselves
over
the
whole
continent
the
european
races
when
they
arrived
in
the
same
continent
pursued
an
opposite
policy
they
at
once
coã¶perated
in
modifying
their
environment
the
result
is
that
a
population
more
than
twenty
times
that
of
the
indian
population
now
occupies
the
same
territory
and
the
continent
is
not
yet
full
again
there
are
associations
of
different
species
which
mutually
coã¶perate
this
differentiation
of
species
is
exhibited
in
the
simplest
physical
entities
such
as
the
association
between
electrons
and
positive
nuclei
and
in
the
whole
realm
of
animate
nature
the
trees
in
a
brazilian
forest
depend
upon
the
association
of
various
species
of
organisms
each
of
which
is
mutually
dependent
on
the
other
species
a
single
tree
by
itself
is
dependent
upon
all
the
adverse
chances
of
shifting
circumstances
the
wind
stunts
it:
the
variations
in
temperature
check
its
foliage:
the
rains
denude
its
soil:
its
leaves
are
blown
away
and
are
lost
for
the
purpose
of
fertilisation
you
may
obtain
individual
specimens
of
fine
trees
either
in
exceptional
circumstances
or
where
human
cultivation
has
intervened
but
in
nature
the
normal
way
in
which
trees
flourish
is
by
their
association
in
a
forest
each
tree
may
lose
something
of
its
individual
perfection
of
growth
but
they
mutually
assist
each
other
in
preserving
the
conditions
for
survival
the
soil
is
preserved
and
shaded
and
the
microbes
necessary
for
its
fertility
are
neither
scorched
nor
frozen
nor
washed
away
a
forest
is
the
triumph
of
the
organisation
of
mutually
dependent
species
further
a
species
of
microbes
which
kills
the
forest
also
exterminates
itself
again
the
two
sexes
exhibit
the
same
advantage
of
differentiation
in
the
history
of
the
world
the
prize
has
not
gone
to
those
species
which
specialised
in
methods
of
violence
or
even
in
defensive
armour
in
fact
nature
began
with
producing
animals
encased
in
hard
shells
for
defence
against
the
ills
of
life
it
also
experimented
in
size
but
smaller
animals
without
external
armour
warm-blooded
sensitive
and
alert
have
cleared
these
monsters
off
the
face
of
the
earth
also
the
lions
and
tigers
are
not
the
successful
species
there
is
something
in
the
ready
use
of
force
which
defeats
its
own
object
its
main
defect
is
that
it
bars
coã¶peration
every
organism
requires
an
environment
of
friends
partly
to
shield
it
from
violent
changes
and
partly
to
supply
it
with
its
wants
the
gospel
of
force
is
incompatible
with
a
social
life
by
force
i
mean
antagonism
in
its
most
general
sense
almost
equally
dangerous
is
the
gospel
of
uniformity
the
differences
between
the
nations
and
races
of
mankind
are
required
to
preserve
the
conditions
under
which
higher
development
is
possible
one
main
factor
in
the
upward
trend
of
animal
life
has
been
the
power
of
wandering
perhaps
this
is
why
the
armour-plated
monsters
fared
badly
they
could
not
wander
animals
wander
into
new
conditions
they
have
to
adapt
themselves
or
die
mankind
has
wandered
from
the
trees
to
the
plains
from
the
plains
to
the
seacoast
from
climate
to
climate
from
continent
to
continent
and
from
habit
of
life
to
habit
of
life
when
man
ceases
to
wander
he
will
cease
to
ascend
in
the
scale
of
being
physical
wandering
is
still
important
but
greater
still
is
the
power
of
manâ€™s
spiritual
adventuresâ€”adventures
of
thought
adventures
of
passionate
feeling
adventures
of
aesthetic
experience
a
diversification
among
human
communities
is
essential
for
the
provision
of
the
incentive
and
material
for
the
odyssey
of
the
human
spirit
other
nations
of
different
habits
are
not
enemies:
they
are
godsends
men
require
of
their
neighbours
something
sufficiently
akin
to
be
understood
something
sufficiently
different
to
provoke
attention
and
something
great
enough
to
command
admiration
we
must
not
expect
however
all
the
virtues
we
should
even
be
satisfied
if
there
is
something
odd
enough
to
be
interesting
modern
science
has
imposed
on
humanity
the
necessity
for
wandering
its
progressive
thought
and
its
progressive
technology
make
the
transition
through
time
from
generation
to
generation
a
true
migration
into
uncharted
seas
of
adventure
the
very
benefit
of
wandering
is
that
it
is
dangerous
and
needs
skill
to
avert
evils
we
must
expect
therefore
that
the
future
will
disclose
dangers
it
is
the
business
of
the
future
to
be
dangerous
and
it
is
among
the
merits
of
science
that
it
equips
the
future
for
its
duties
the
prosperous
middle
classes
who
ruled
the
nineteenth
century
placed
an
excessive
value
upon
placidity
of
existence
they
refused
to
face
the
necessities
for
social
reform
imposed
by
the
new
industrial
system
and
they
are
now
refusing
to
face
the
necessities
for
intellectual
reform
imposed
by
the
new
knowledge
the
middle
class
pessimism
over
the
future
of
the
world
comes
from
a
confusion
between
civilisation
and
security
in
the
immediate
future
there
will
be
less
security
than
in
the
immediate
past
less
stability
it
must
be
admitted
that
there
is
a
degree
of
instability
which
is
inconsistent
with
civilisation
but
on
the
whole
the
great
ages
have
been
unstable
ages
i
have
endeavoured
in
these
lectures
to
give
a
record
of
a
great
adventure
in
the
region
of
thought
it
was
shared
in
by
all
the
races
of
western
europe
it
developed
with
the
slowness
of
a
mass
movement
half
a
century
is
its
unit
of
time
the
tale
is
the
epic
of
an
episode
in
the
manifestation
of
reason
it
tells
how
a
particular
direction
of
reason
emerges
in
a
race
by
the
long
preparation
of
antecedent
epochs
how
after
its
birth
its
subject-matter
gradually
unfolds
itself
how
it
attains
its
triumphs
how
its
influence
moulds
the
very
springs
of
action
of
mankind
and
finally
how
at
its
moment
of
supreme
success
its
limitations
disclose
themselves
and
call
for
a
renewed
exercise
of
the
creative
imagination
the
moral
of
the
tale
is
the
power
of
reason
its
decisive
influence
on
the
life
of
humanity
the
great
conquerors
from
alexander
to
caesar
and
from
caesar
to
napoleon
influenced
profoundly
the
lives
of
subsequent
generations
but
the
total
effect
of
this
influence
shrinks
to
insignificance
if
compared
to
the
entire
transformation
of
human
habits
and
human
mentality
produced
by
the
long
line
of
men
of
thought
from
thales
to
the
present
day
men
individually
powerless
but
ultimately
