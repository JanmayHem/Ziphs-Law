my
discuss
of

will
be

introduc
by
a
quotat
from

â€˜centuryâ€™

we
are
told
in

memoir
by
hi

that
thi
work
wa
compos
in
the
last
five

of
hi
life
so
it
must
be
date
between
1620
and
1626
the
quotat
run
thus:
â€œit
is
certain
that
all
bodi
whatsoev
though
they
have
no
sens
yet
they
have
percept
for
when
one
bodi
is
appli
to
anoth
there
is
a
kind
of
elect
to
embrac
that
which
is
agreeabl
and
to
exclud
or
expel
that
which
is
ingrat
and
whether
the
bodi
be
alter
or
alter
evermor
a
percept
precedeth
oper
for
els
all
bodi
would
be
like
one
to
anoth
and
sometim
thi
percept
in
some
kind
of
bodi
is
far
more
subtil
than
sens
so
that
sens
is
but
a
dull
thing
in
comparison
of
it:
we
see
a
weatherglass
will
find
the
least
differ
of
the
weather
in
heat
or
cold
when
we
find
it
not
and
thi
percept
is
sometim
at
a
distanc
as
well
as
upon
the
touch
as
when
the
loadston
draweth
iron

naphtha

enquir

to

as
well
as

divin
for

there

the

prove
to

a
somewhat
more

the

with

that
thi
is

when

wa
one
of
the

of
the

which
desert
the

doubt
upon
the

of

when

my

is
that
the
veri
baffl
task
of
appli
reason
to
elicit
the
gener
characterist
of
the
immedi

as
set
befor
us
in
direct
cognit
is
a
necessari
preliminari
if
we
are
to
justifi
induct
unless
inde
we
are
content
to

it
upon
our

instinct
that
of

it
is
all
right
either
there

someth
about
the
immedi

which
afford
knowledg
of

the

or
we
are
reduc
to
utter
sceptic
as
to
memori
and
induct
it
is
imposs
to
over-emphasis
the
point
that
the
key
to
the
process
of
induct
as
use
either
in
scienc
or
in
our
ordinari
life
is
to
be

in

thi

that

but
when
we
attempt
to
justifi
thi
suppress
of

we
find
that
though
there
are
entiti
left

to
the

we
talk
about
yet
these

the

thi

i
have
attach

thi

to
say
that
a

ha
simpl

mean
that
in

again
thi
concept

in

a

of

of

i
must
first
give
my
main
reason
for
ignor
nineteenth
centuri
idealismâ€”i
am
speak
of
the
philosoph
ideal
which
find
the
ultim
mean
of
realiti
in
mental
that
is
fulli
cognit
thi
idealist
school
as
hitherto
develop
ha
been
too
much
divorc
from
the
scientif
outlook
it
ha
swallow
the
scientif
scheme
in
it
entireti
as
be
the
onli
render
of
the
fact
of
natur
and
ha
then
explain
it
as
be
an
idea
in
the
ultim
mental
in
the
case
of
absolut
ideal
the
world
of
natur
is
just
one
of
the
idea
somehow
differenti
the
uniti
of
the
absolute:
in
the
case
of
pluralist
ideal
involv
monad
mental
thi
world
is
the
greatest
common
measur
of
the
variou
idea
which
differenti
the
variou
mental
uniti
of
the
variou
monad
but
howev
you
take
it
these
idealist
school
have
conspicu
fail
to
connect
in
ani
organ
fashion
the
fact
of
natur
with
their
idealist
philosophi
so
far
as
concern
what
will
be
said
in
these
lectur
your
ultim
outlook
may
be
realist
or
idealist
my
point
is
that
a
further
stage
of
provision
realism
is
requir
in
which
the
scientif
scheme
is
recast
and
found
upon
the
ultim
concept
of
organ
in
outlin
my
procedur
is
to
start
from
the
analysi
of
the
statu
of
space
and
of
time
or
in
modern
phraseolog
the
statu
of
space-tim
there
are
two
charact
of
either
thing
are
separ
by
space
and
are
separ
by
time:
but
they
are
also
togeth
in
space
and
togeth
in
time
even
if
they
be
not
contemporan
i
will
call
these
charact
the
â€˜_separative_â€™
and
the
â€˜_prehensive_â€™
charact
of
space-tim
there
is
yet
a
third
charact
of
space-tim
everyth
which
is
in
space
receiv
a
definit
limit
of
some
sort
so
that
in
a
sens
it
ha
just
that
shape
which
it
doe
have
and
no
other
also
in
some
sens
it
is
just
in
thi
place
and
in
no
other
analog
for
time
a
thing
endur
dure
a
certain
period
and
through
no
other
period
i
will
call
thi
the
â€˜_modal_â€™
charact
of
space-tim
it
is
evid
that
the
modal
charact
taken
by
itself
give
rise
to
the
idea
of
simpl
locat
but
it
must
be
conjoin
with
the
separ
and
prehens
charact
for
simplic
of
thought
i
will
first
speak
of
space
onli
and
will
afterward
extend
the
same
treatment
to
time
the
volum
is
the
most
concret
element
of
space
but
the
separ
charact
of
space
analys
a
volum
into
sub-volum
and
so
on
indefinit
accordingli
take
the
separ
charact
in
isol
we
should
infer
that
a
volum
is
a
mere
multipl
of
non-volumin
element
of
point
in
fact
but
it
is
the
uniti

which
is
the
ultim
fact
of

the

thi
hall
as
a

a
construct
of

accordingli
the

have
a

is

held

no

is

the

whose

i
must
consid
at
some

is
bishop
berkeley
quit
at
the
commenc
of
the
epoch
he
made
all
the
right
critic
at

in
principl
it
would
be
untru
to
say
that
he

no

accordingli
berkeley

made

in

when

also
what

in

might
have
disturb
the

so
to
say
that
berkeley

uninfluenti

the

would
certainli
be
absurd
but
all
the

he
fail
to
affect
the
main
stream
of
scientif
thought
it
flow
on
as
if
he
had
never
written
it
gener
success
made
it

sinc
the

ha
alway
remain
perfectli
satisfi
with
it
peculiar
abstract
they

and
that
is
suffici
for
it
the
point
befor
us
is
that
thi
scientif
field
of
thought
is
now
in
the
twentieth
centuri
too
narrow
for
the
concret
fact
which
are
befor
it
for
analysi
thi
is
true
even
in
physic
and
is
more
especi
urgent
in
the
biolog
scienc
thu
in
order
to
understand
the
difficulti
of
modern
scientif
thought
and
also
it
reaction
on
the
modern
world
we
should
have
in
our
mind
some
concept
of
a
wider
field
of
abstract
a
more
concret
analysi
which
shall
stand
nearer
to
the
complet
concret
of
our
intuit
experi
such
an
analysi
should
find
in
itself
a
nich
for
the
concept
of
matter
and
spirit
as
abstract
in
term
of
which
much
of
our
physic
experi
can
be
interpret
it
is
in
the
search
for
thi
wider
basi
for
scientif

that
berkeley

shortli
after
the

of

had
complet
their
work
and
laid
hi
finger
exactli
on
the
weak
spot
which
they
had
left
i
do
not

to
consid
either
the

ideal

the

trace

my

is

of

of

in

you
will
rememb
that
i
have
alreadi
state
that
the
key
of
the
problem
lie
in
the
notion
of
simpl
locat
berkeley
in
effect
criticis
thi
notion
he
also
rais
the
question
what
do
we
mean
by
thing
be
realis
in
the
world
of
nature?
in
section
23
and
24
of
hi
principl
of
human
knowledg
berkeley
give
hi
answer
to
thi
latter
question
i
will
quot
some
detach
sentenc
from
those
sections:
â€œ23
but
say
you
sure
there
is
noth
easier
than
for
me
to
imagin
tree
for
instanc
in
a
park
or
book
exist
in
a
closet
and
nobodi
by
to
perceiv
them
i
answer
you
may
so
there
is
no
difficulti
in
it
but
what
is
all
thi
i
beseech
you
more
than
frame
in
your
mind
certain
idea
which
you
call
book
and
tree
and
at
the
same
time
omit
to
frame
the
idea
of
ani
one
that
may
perceiv
them?...â€
â€œwhen
we
do
our
utmost
to
conceiv
the
exist
of
extern

we
are
all
the
while
onli
contempl
our

the

take
no
notic
of

delud
to

it

doe
conceiv

at
the

they
are

exist

â€œ24
it
is
veri
obviou
upon
the
least
inquiri
into
our
thought
to
know
whether
it
be
possibl
for
us
to

els
noth
at

again
there
is
a
veri
remark
passag
in
section
10
of
the
fourth
dialogu
of
berkeleyâ€™
alciphron
i
have
alreadi
quot
it
at
greater
length
in
my
principl
of
natur
knowledge_:
â€œ_euphranor
tell
me
alciphron
can
you
discern
the

castle?
alciphron
i
cannot
at
thi
distanc
it
seem
onli
a
small
round
tower
euph
but
i
who
have
been
at
it
know
that
it
is
no
small
round
tower
but
a
larg
squar
build
with
battlement
and
turret
which
it
seem
you
do
not
see
alc
what
will
you
infer
from
thence?
euph
i
would
infer
that
the
veri

which
you
strictli
and
properli
perceiv
by

is
not
that

it
not

some
analog
exampl
concern
a
planet
and
a
cloud
are
then
cite
in
the
dialogu
and
thi
passag
final
conclud
with:

it
is
made
explicit
in
the
first
passag
alreadi
quot
that
berkeley
himself

solut

rais
difficulti
not

those
which

is

enabl
us
to

to

the
scientif

in
a
way

i
recur
to
the
passag
from
franci

alreadi
quot
in
the
previou
lecture:
â€œit

pervad

it
would
hardli

presenc

in

the
point

that
we

the

are

it
not

outcom
of

that
for

what

those
who
believ
that
our

doe
tell

that
the

thi

there

the

pave
the
way
for

than

the
point
is
that
the
actual
thing
experienc
enter
into
a
common

which
transcend
knowledg
though
it

enter

on
equal
term
in
these
lectur
i
am
give
the
outlin
of
what
i
consid
to
be
the
essenti
of
an
objectivist
philosophi
adapt
to
the
requir
of
scienc
and
to
the
concret
experi
of
mankind
apart
from
the
detail
critic
of
the
difficulti
rais
by
subjectiv
in
ani
form
my
broad
reason
for
distrust
it
are
three
in
number
one
reason
aris
from
the
direct
interrog
of
our
percept
experi
it
appear
from
thi
interrog
that
we
are
within
a
world
of
colour
sound
and
other
sense-object
relat
in
space
and
time
to
endur
object
such
as
stone
tree
and
human
bodi
we
seem
to
be
ourselv
element
of
thi
world
in
the
same
sens
as
are
the
other
thing
which
we
perceiv
but
the
subjectivist
even
the
moder
intermedi
subjectivist
make
thi
world
as
thu
describ
depend
on
us
in
a
way
which
directli
travers
our
naã¯v
experi
i
hold
that
the
ultim
appeal
is
to
naã¯v
experi
and
that
is
whi
i
lay
such
stress
on
the
evid
of
poetri
my
point
is
that
in
our
sense-experi
we
know
away
from
and
beyond
our
own
person
wherea
the
subjectivist
hold
that
in
such
experi
we
mere
know
about
our
own
person
even
the
intermedi
subjectivist
place
our
person
between
the
world
we
know
of
and
the
common
world
which
he
admit
the
world
we
know
of
is
for
him
the
intern
strain
of
our
person
under
the
stress
of
the
common
world
which
lie
behind
my
second
reason
for
distrust
subjectiv
is
base
on
the
particular
content
of
experi
our
histor
knowledg
tell
us
of
age
in
the
past
when
so
far
as
we
can
see
no
live
be
exist
on
earth
again
it
also
tell
us
of
countless
star-system
whose
detail
histori
remain
beyond
our
ken
consid
even
the
moon
and
the
earth
what
is
go
on
within
the
interior
of
the
earth
and
on
the
far
side
of
the
moon
our
percept
lead
us
to
infer
that
there
is
someth
happen
in
the
star
someth
happen
within
the
earth
and
someth
happen
on
the
far
side
of
the
moon
also
they
tell
us
that
in
remot
age
there
were
thing
happen
but
all
these
thing
which
it
appear
certainli
happen
are
either
unknown
in
detail
or
els
are
reconstruct
by
inferenti
evid
in
the
face
of
thi
content
of
our
person
experi
it
is
difficult
to
believ
that
the
experienc
world
is
an
attribut
of
our
own
person
my
third
reason
is
base
upon
the
instinct
for
action
just
as
sense-percept
seem
to
give
knowledg
of
what
lie
beyond
individu
so
action
seem
to
issu
in
an
instinct
for
self-transcend
the
activ
pass
beyond
self
into
the
known
transcend
world
it
is
here
that
final
end
are
of
import
for
it
is
not
activ
urg
from
behind
which
pass
out
into
the
veil
world
of
the
intermedi
subjectivist
it
is
activ
direct
to
determin
end
in
the
known
world
and
yet
it
is
activ
transcend
self
and
it
is
activ
within
the
known
world
it
follow
therefor
that
the
world
as
known
transcend
the
subject
which
is
cognis
of
it
the
subjectivist
posit
ha
been
popular
among
those
who
have
been
engag
in

a
philosoph

recent
theori

amid

everyon
want
to

do
not

how

can
be
establish
in
the
absenc

i
will
not
argu
thi
point
in
detail
but
in
the
absenc
of
a
transcend
of
thought
or
a
transcend
of
the
world
of
sens
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
the
subjectivist
is
to
divest
himself
of
hi
solitari
nor
doe
the
intermedi
subjectivist
appear
to
get

from

in
the

between

doe
not
coincid
with
that
between
objectiv

subjectiv
both
realist
and
idealist
can
start
from
an
object
standpoint
they
may
both
agre
that
the
world
disclos
in
sense-percept
is
a
common
world
transcend
the
individu
percipi
but
the

idealist
when
he
come
to
analys
what
the
realiti
of

the

is

that
of

there
is
a
further
peculiar
which
we

bring
an

he

one
mode

onli
radiat
it

in

so
that
a

wherea
the
other
mode
can
onli

so
that

also
a

to

each

a

proport

thi

the

now
suggest
an

with

i
put
it
in

a
question:
ha
our

been
taint
by
the

in
so
far
as
it
assum
without

that
endur
must
mean
undifferenti

throughout
the
life-histori
concerned?
perhap
you
notic
that
in
a
previou
chapter
i
use
the
word
â€˜reiterationâ€™
as
a
synonym
of
â€˜endurance.â€™
it
obvious
is
not
quit
synonym
in
it
mean
and
now
i
want
to
suggest
that
reiter
where
it
differ
from
endur
is
more
nearli
what
the
organ
theori
requir
the
differ
is
veri
analog
to
that
between
the
galilean
and
the
aristotelians:
aristotl
said
â€˜restâ€™
where
galileo
ad
â€˜or
uniform
motion
in
a
straight
line.â€™
thu
in
the
organ
theori
a
pattern
need
not
endur
in
undifferenti
same
through
time
the
pattern
may
be
essenti
one
of
aesthet
contrast
requir
a
laps
of
time
for
it
unfold
a
tune
is
an
exampl
of
such
a
pattern
thu
the
endur
of
the
pattern
now
mean
the
reiter
of
it
success
of
contrast
thi
is
obvious
the
most
gener
notion
of
endur
on
the
organ
theori
and
â€˜reiterationâ€™
is
perhap
the
word
which
express
it
with
most
direct
but
when
we
translat
thi
notion
into
the
abstract
of
physic
it
at
onc
becom
the
technic
notion
of
â€˜vibration.â€™
thi
vibrat
is
not
the
vibratori
locomotion:
it
is
the
vibrat
of
organ
deform
there
are
certain
indic
in
modern
physic
that
for
the

which
then
dissolv

we
may
conjectur
that
such
a

principl
the

principl

what
it

cannot

as

etern
object

it
own
uniqu
contribut
to
each
actual
occas
thi
uniqu
contribut
is
ident
for
all
such
occas
in
respect
to
the
fact
that
the
object
in
all
mode
of
ingress
is
just
it
ident
self
but
it
vari
from
one
occas
to
anoth
in
respect
to
the
differ
of
it
mode
of

thu
the
metaphys
statu
of

in

occas
thi
conclus
bring
us
to
the
second
metaphys
principle:
an
etern
object

an
abstract
entiti
cannot
be

it

it
is
disconnect
from
it
actual
mode
of
ingress
into
definit
actual
occas
thi
principl
is
express
by
the
statement
that
each
etern
object

a
â€˜relat

thi
relat

statu

essenc

the

center
it

the

deal
with

that
it

for

i

the
complet
answer
to
thi
question
is
that
the
relationship
among

are
as
unfathom

their

as
are

there

the

a

these
type
of

into
the
essenc
of
anoth
is
to
note
that
they
are
involv
in
the
mode
of
realis
of

hierarchi
discuss
in
the
previou

the
spatio-tempor

involv
in
those

as

have
all
a

of
î±

thu
the

lend
their

therebi
convert
spatio-tempor
modal

the

lend
their

therebi
limit
the

onli
under
those

thu
in
the

way
as
seen
in
the
previou
chapter
that

a
synthesi
of
all

everi

or
expans
of

which
were
not

at
the

we
are
told
by
logician
that
a

must
be
either
true
or
fals
and
that
there
is
no
middl

in

we
may

that
a

express
an

but
that
it
is
subject

which
at

remain
undiscov
it
is
a

of

that
we
are

and

that
the
onli
formul
of
these

which
we
are
abl
to
make

a

standpoint
of
concept
which
may
have
to
be
modifi
i
will
give
you
two
illustr
both
from
science:
galileo
said
that
the
earth
move
and
that
the
sun
is
fix
the
inquisit
said
that
the
earth
is
fix
and
the
sun
move
and
newtonian
astronom
adopt
an
absolut
theori
of
space
said
that
both
the
sun
and
the
earth
move
but
now
we
say
that
ani
one
of
these
three
statement
is
equal
true
provid
that
you
have
fix
your
sens
of
â€˜restâ€™
and
â€˜motionâ€™
in
the
way
requir
by
the
statement
adopt
at
the
date
of
galileoâ€™
controversi
with
the
inquisit
galileoâ€™
way
of
state
the
fact
wa
beyond
question
the
fruit
procedur
for
the
sake
of
scientif
research
but
in
itself
it
wa
not
more
true
than
the
formul
of
the
inquisit
but
at
that
time
the
modern
concept
of
rel
motion
were
in
nobodyâ€™
mind
so
that
the
statement
were
made
in
ignor
of
the
qualif
requir
for
their
more
perfect
truth
yet
thi
question
of
the
motion
of
the
earth
and
the
sun
express
a
real
fact
in
the
univers
and
all
side
had
got
hold
of
import
truth
concern
it
but
with
the
knowledg
of
those
time
the
truth
appear
to
be
inconsist
again
i
will
give
you
anoth
exampl
taken
from
the
state
of
modern
physic
scienc
sinc
the
time
of
newton
and
huyghen
in
the
seventeenth
centuri
there
have
been
two
theori
as
to
the
physic
natur
of
light
newtonâ€™
theori
wa
that
a
beam
of
light
consist
of
a
stream
of
veri
minut
particl
or
corpuscl
and
that
we
have
the
sensat
of
light
when
these
corpuscl
strike
the
retina
of
our
eye
huyghensâ€™
theori
wa
that
light
consist
of
veri

wave

in
an

ether
and
that
these
wave
are
travel
along
a

the
two
theori
are
contradictori
in
the
eighteenth
centuri
newtonâ€™
theori
wa
believ
in
the
nineteenth
centuri
huyghensâ€™
theori
wa

to-day
there
is

anoth
larg
group
which
can
be

onli
on
the
corpuscular
theori
scientist
have
to
leav
it
at
that
and
wait
for
the
futur
in
the
hope
of
attain
some
wider
vision
which
reconcil
both
we
should
appli
these
same
principl
to
the
question
in
which
there
is
a
varianc
between
scienc
and
religion
we
would
believ
noth
in
either
sphere
of
thought
which
doe
not
appear
to
us
to
be
certifi
by
solid
reason
base
upon
the
critic
research
either
of
ourselv
or
of
compet
author
but
grant
that
we
have
honestli
taken
thi
precaut
a
clash
between
the
two
on
point
of
detail
where
they
overlap
should
not
lead
us
hastili
to
abandon
doctrin
for
which
we
have
solid
evid
it
may
be
that
we
are
more
interest
in
one
set
of
doctrin
than
in
the
other
but
if
we
have
ani
sens
of
perspect
and
of
the
histori
of
thought
we
shall
wait
and
refrain
from
mutual
anathema
we
should
wait:
but
we
should
not
wait
passiv
or
in
despair
the
clash
is
a
sign
that
there
are
wider
truth
and
finer
perspect
within
which
a
reconcili
of
a
deeper
religion
and
a
more
subtl
scienc
will
be
found
in
one
sens
therefor
the
conflict
between
scienc
and

is
a
slight
matter
which
ha
been

the

now
i
ask
you
would
it
have
been
ration
of
these
men
to
have
despair
becaus
of
thi
conflict

suppos
that
for
some

the

doctrin
had

on

should
sir

lord

have
proclaim
that
chemic

we

at

that
had
hitherto
elud

anoth

to
note
that

have
to
take
into
account
the
whole

is
to

of

fifth

echo
of
that
controversi
still
linger
in

so
far
my
point
ha
been
this:
that
religion
is
the
express
of
one
type
of
fundament
experi
of
mankind:
that
religi

an
increas
accuraci
of
express
disengag
from

imagery:
that
the
interact
between

is
one
great
factor
in
promot
thi
develop
i
now
come
to
my
second
reason
for
the
modern
fade

thi
involv
the
ultim
question
which
i
state
in

we
have
to
know
what
we

that

critic
of
modern
life
appli
throughout
in
whatev
sens
you
constru
the
mean
of
a
commun
it
hold
if
you
appli
it
to
a
nation
a
citi
a
district
an
institut
a
famili
or
even
to
an
individu
there
is
a
develop
of
particular
abstract
and
a
contract
of
concret
appreci
the
whole
is
lost
in
one
of
it
aspect
it
is
not
necessari
for
my
point
that
i
should
maintain
that
our
direct
wisdom
either
as
individu
or
as
commun
is
less
now
than
in
the
past
perhap
it
ha
slightli
improv
but
the
novel
pace
of
progress
requir
a
greater
forc
of
direct
if
disast
are
to
be
avoid
the
point
is
that
the
discoveri
of
the
nineteenth
centuri
were
in
the
direct
of
profession
so
that
we
are
left
with
no
expans
of
wisdom
and
with
greater
need
of
it
wisdom
is
the
fruit
of
a
balanc
develop
it
is
thi
balanc
growth
of
individu
which
it
should
be
the
aim
of
educ
to
secur
the
most
use
discoveri
for
the
immedi
futur
would
concern
the
further
of
thi
aim
without
detriment
to
the
necessari
intellectu
profession
my
own
critic
of
our
tradit
educ
method
is
that
they
are
far
too
much
occupi
with
intellectu
analysi
and
with
the
acquir
of
formularis
inform
what
i
mean
is
that
we
neglect
to
strengthen
habit
of
concret
appreci
of
the
individu
fact
in
their
full
interplay
of
emerg
valu
and
that
we
mere
emphasis
abstract
formul
which
ignor
thi
aspect
of
the
interplay
of
divers
valu
in
everi
countri
the
problem
of
the
balanc
of
the
gener

specialist
educ
is
under
consider
i
cannot
speak
with
first-hand
knowledg
of
ani
countri
but
my
own
i
know
that
there
among
practic
educationalist
there
is
consider
dissatisfact
with
the
exist
practic
also
the
adapt
of
the
whole
system
to
the
need
of
a
democrat
commun
is
veri
far
from
be
solv
i
do
not
think
that
the
secret
of
the
solut
lie
in
term
of
the
antithesi
between
thorough
in
special
knowledg
and
gener
knowledg
of
a
slighter
charact
the
make-weight
which
balanc
the
thorough
of
the
specialist
intellectu
train
should
be
of
a
radic
differ
kind
from
pure
intellectu
analyt
knowledg
at
present
our
educ
combin
a
thorough
studi
of
a
few

with
a
slighter
studi
of
a
larger
number
of
abstract
we
are
too
exclus
bookish
in
our
scholast
routin
the
gener
train
should
aim
at
elicit
our
concret
apprehens
and
should
satisfi
the
itch
of
youth
to
be
do
someth
there
should
be
some
analysi
even
here
but
onli
just
enough
to
illustr
the
